In this case the LL has been aware of your partner's presence for years, unless they are in the habit of issuing access cards to strangers. He is entitled to a card in my opinion.

2647181,"I think you mean your brother is ""schiizophrenic.""  Depending on what he did when he exposed himself (masturbated, touching himself in a lewd manner, etc.), he could be charged with a serious felony called lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 years old, a violation of Penal Code section 288(a), to a misdemeanor offense called ""annoying or molesting a child,"" a violation of Penal Code section 647.6.  The 288(a) carries a maximum of 8 years in State Prison, while the 647.6 has a maximum term of 1 year.  His mental illness would play a big role in deciding how to address what happened and what needs to be done to prevent it from happening again.  If criminal proceedings were initiated, they'd kick your brother out of your house to protect your 7-year old from additional acts of exposure, and your brother will wind up having to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.  He may come to be labeled a mentally disordered sex offender.  If his exposure was or will be reported to the police, he needs or will need a lawyer immediately to protect his interests."

Lawyers from out of town won't be intimidated by a judge who they don't routinely appear in front of because they don't have to fear reprisal.  A judge is only intimidating if a lawyer thinks that a judge will take things out against him and his clients in the future. (Even then most lawyers still won't be intimidated) But if a lawyer has little or no chance of seeing this judge again, what reason would they have for being intimidated."
2428196,"The answer is that we have to convert what would have been powers from the power of attorney into an administrator if no will appoints an executor, or to the executor if the will leaves unnamed executor. We do that through our state's Department in order to empower our client to bring the wrongful death action. I wrongful death actions involve both Supreme Court for the underlying litigation and Surrogate's Court to empower the client to bring the action initially. We also have the power to negotiate a settlement and go back to one of the two courts, depending on the circumstances, to ask for approval of a wrongful death settlement-so just because we agreed in trial the case does not mean that it has to end in trial-although we do try many cases.

The reason for the move, how it affects the non-moving party's parenting time, how it affects the children's quality of life, and the stability of the home are the primary considerations. You should expect to modify the parenting plan to ensure that your ex-wife's access to her children isn't diminished (perhaps she will see the children every summer instead of every other summer?), but as long as you act in good faith to preserve her relationship with her children, you should be allowed to move.

The suit can be filed without regard to the manner in which property is owned, except that property owned by a husband and wife as an estate by the entirety is not subject to partition during the joint lives of the spouses and while they are still married. In a partition action, the court is asked to divide the property among the owners. If the property is not subject to division (like your house), the court can order the property sold and the proceeds distributed among the owners."

The Florida Supreme Court approved Family Law Court forms are available right on the Duval County Clerk of Courts website. Just download them, check your boxes, and there you go. Easy peasy...or is it? Many people find the forms confusing and depending on their issues, too difficult to fill out. When they do see a lawyer they realize they have failed to include an important issue.   My question to you is WHY would you want to do that when you know you are going to hire a lawyer anyway after she responds? I'm not getting your angle here and I don't really think it's about costs. Becareful, even though the other attorneys have advised you about how we go about Amending a Petition and fixing it after the fact, there is also the chance that you may not get a ""do over"" and the court denys your Motion to Amend. Wr have really sharp Judges in Duval County. I would strongly suggest you retainer a lawyer right from the start and leave the games for the ball field. Good luck."
1799890,"I think you want to create a sculpture by literally taking parts of dolls and compiling them together in an artistic expression of ""the repetitive use of V-forms.""  You're creating art -- not a commercial product.  If that's correct then I suggest my colleagues have missed the issue.   The First Amendment strongly protects expressive works -- even those created by compiling bits of other people's property. The analysis, I think, is NOT copyright ""substantial similarity"" because the dolls, if they're protected by a copyright at all, are not being reproduced [only parts of the actual dolls are being used].  The only IP right that could be at issue is trademark / trade dress if the portions of the dolls being used are still brand-recognizable. And even then the test would not be ""likely to confuse"" but, rather, the Rogers ""artistic relevance"" test.  In short, speak with your own intellectual property attorney to discuss the specfics of your plan. IF you intend on mass-producing the sculpture then that adds even another layer or two of analysis. Good luck."

These technically aren't statutes of limitations, but they are a limitation on how long someone can try to enforce a judgment. Right now, you're well within the lifespan of judgment.   Your options are fairly limited. Your time for appealing the judgment has long since past. There is a procedure which will allow you to obtain relief from the judgment under Rule 60 of the N.C.

Ultimately, I'd suggest going to the judgment creditor and perhaps making some sort of cash settlement offer in exchange for the creditor mark the judgment paid in full in the public record.

1813842,"There are formulas that take into account many factors. Do you have a liquidated damages clause? You also mentioned pain and suffering and punitive damages.  I would need more details to be able to better answer your question.  I would not leave it to the court to determine the amount of damages your seeking. You must support you actual damages with facts. Here is the basic info. You should look at: Compensatory Damages  The most common type of personal injury damages are compensatory damages. This type of damage is meant to compensate the injured victim and to help make him whole financially. Some major types of compensatory damages include:  Medical Expenses.åÊThis can include the cost of your hospital bills and medical treatment. This can also include costs associated with follow-up visits and any ongoing therapy you receive. This type of damage amount is usually easy to determine as you have medical bills and other receipts. Property Damage.åÊIf you were injured in a car accident, you may have auto repair bills and other estimates for property damage. Similar to medical expenses, this type of damage amount is typically easy to determine. Lost Wages.åÊIf injuries or follow-up treatment cause you to miss time at work, you may be entitled to seek lost wages. Lost wages can include both the money you already lost as well as the wages that you may lose in the future from not working. You will need to calculate how much time you already missed and make a reasonable estimate of how much time you may need to miss in the future. Pain and Suffering.åÊBesides financial harm, you may also experience pain, suffering, and other emotional injuries. This can include emotional distress, psychological harm, and even the loss of enjoyment that you may have from pursuing your hobbies or spending time with your loved ones. As you can imagine, this can be difficult to quantify.  Punitive Damages  Along with compensatory damages, you may also be able to seek additionalåÊpunitive damages. Punitive damages may be awarded when a defendant's conduct is particularly willful, wanton, malicious, vindictive, or oppressive. Punitive damages are awarded not as compensation to the victim, but as punishment to the wrongdoer."
1809734,"The government is free to add whatever charges they like provided that the probationary period has not expired (and tolling obviously precludes natural expiration).  I have seen this happen, but, because Judge's enjoy wide discretion in VOP sentencing,  it is extremely rare.  The simple fact is that even on the most basic of VOP's the probationer can be sentenced up to the statutory max, so, if the government believes that the Court is going to fire the rockets and launch the probationer into sentencing space (most prosecutors and PO's ""know"" their Judges and have a pretty good feel for how they sentence) then there's no need to tack on additional VOP counts.    I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."

You can also sue them for breach of contract, breach of warranty of habitability, and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  As my colleague mentioned, you can sue them for personal injury, but there are so many more ways to come at them.

1824576,"Painting and such may increase the damages you will have trouble collecting, but will not instill ownership on the tenant."
1804081,"You can work while you collect early retirement, but you have to be very careful about it. For any full-year that you are retired after reaching age 62 and before full-retirement age, you can earn up to $15,480 (in 2014, the number changes each year). If you elect retire early mid-year (any time after January), and you have already earned more than the annual limit, you can only receive retirement benefits in any month that your earnings are less than $1290 (again this number changes each year). If you go over $1290 in any month, you are not entitled to retirement benefits in that month. (See retiring mid-year rule: http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/rule.htm).  If your retirement is starting in January of the calendar year (or for any year after your first year of retirement), and you are under full-retirement age, you are permitted to earn up to $15,480 for the full year in 2014. Once you make more than $15,480, $1 is deducted from your benefit for ever $2 you earn. Social Security will ask for an estimate of your earnings for the year (and if you are remaining at the same job and number of hours as before retirement, will use your prior year earnings), and if you are over $15,480, they will withhold the money from benefits payable in the beginning of the year.   So if you plan to make $25,480, you would be $10,000 above the earnings limit for the year, so $5,000 will be withheld from your benefits. Instead of waiting for you to actually earn the money during the year, the first $5,000 of your Social Security retirement benefits would be withheld. If you are entitled to $1,000 per month, this means that you would not receive benefits for the first 5 months of the year, and although you are retired, you would only receive benefits starting in June of the year based on your estimated earnings.   My recommendation is to schedule an appointment with Social Security to discuss retirement with a claims representative. Have your most recent pay stub available, and also have an estimate available of the amount that you plan to make after you retire. Based on this information, a representative should be able to explain how your retirement would be impacted. Once you have that information, if you still have questions, contact a financial planner/estate attorney to decide what makes most sense for you.  Sorry for the long answer, but this is a much more confusing issue that it would initially appear. Once you reach full retirement age (age 66 if you were born in 1947 or 1948), you are able to make up to $41,400 in that calendar year in the months prior to your birthday, and an unlimited amount after your birthday. Again, please remember that these numbers change each year. All the dollar amounts I have provided are for 2014 only."

Thus, you don't indicate any right you have to a lower monthly plan payment than the mortgage. Why would your attorney put in an amount also different than the contract payment..I don't understand!

A lawsuit based on an agreement that is not written down must be brought within 3  years. When the time starts and stops running is often a main dispute in a lawsuit.  Moreover, you likely has a statute of frauds problem. That is, in your type of case, the agreement must be written down or the court will dismiss it.

1815895,"Only the court can make authorize this. Essentially, the plaintiff (landlord) would dismiss your brother in law and add your ex-husband.  Since your ex-husband was not party to the case originally, he will need to be served with the lawsuit and given the opportunity to respond to the lawsuit, before any judgment can validly apply. He will have the defense that he was not on the contract, which may mean the landlord cannot get a judgment against him. Thus, the outcome you desire is unlikely to occur, because then the landlord would get nothing for the unpaid rent.  Your brother in law should consult with an experienced debt collection defense attorney to get this resolved and behind him. The judgment presently hangs over his head, making him unable to buy any real estate, refinance a home he may own, and always worried that the collection attorney will levy the funds in his bank account or garnish his wages with this unpaid judgment.

You should consult with an experienced local attorney practicing consumer debt collection defense before making any sort of payment or resolution. You can also request that the attorney provide verification of the debt , including the dates when incurred and any payment history.  It maybe that they filed a complaint against you and got a judgment , a judgment is good for 8 years and can be renewed. If they already have a judgment  you may benefit from a consultation with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney."

If you did not pay the security deposit and have not given the landlord a penny, AND YOUR LEASE also says a security deposit is required, you may not have yet completed the terms of the lease so the lease   might not yet be valid.   So you still might have a way to get ""out"" if you have not actually gotten ""in"" to the lease fully.   It truly does depend on all the terms of the lease.   Otherwise it is best to explain the situation as soon as possible to the landlord so they can try to get someone else in there ASAP to mitigate the situation.   Hopefully that helps!"

1827890,"I take it he was convicted after a trial and not by entering a plea of guilty or no contest.  Mr. Dane is correct about the timing for filing the appeal.  Usually, a judge will inform you of your appellate rights after the sentencing.  Often the lawyer who represented him at trial will offer to file the Notice of Appeal for the client, listing the client as ""pro per"" as the appeal is not part of a trial retainer.  If he used the Public Defender, they may be appointed to do the appeal.  Remember, there has to be grounds for the appeal, such as an error by the Judge in admitting evidence or improperly instructing the jury.   If he pled to the charge, it is an entirely different process as he will have to file a Motion to Withdraw the plea; again needing some legal grounds, such as ineffective counsel.   Appeals can be expensive as the appellate lawyer has to read the entire transcript to find the errors. It would be helpful to know what the charge was and how long the trial lasted, not including the jury deliberations."

However, Virginia does have the same concept (deferral with terms followed by an eventual dismissal), it is just known by a different name and does not apply in all cases.  This sort of disposition is extremely favorable, as it essentially allows for a dismissal even though the accused is in fact guilty of the alleged offense, and it is the sort of outcome that an experienced Virginia Criminal Defense Attorney can work out in certain cases.  One thing you should know is that in Fairfax County the prosecuting attorneys do not speak with unrepresented people so there is absolutely no opportunity to negotiate the case with a prosecuting attorney unless you hire counsel to represent you.  In a few select types of cases, the Court may offer this type of disposition to folks without counsel, but I strongly recommend having the assistance of counsel to ensure you get the best possible result.

1830253,"That is a standard provision in many contingency retainer agreements.  Some attorneys will advance the costs for you and then deduct them from any later recovery.  Some attorneys won't advance costs.  It most likely depends on the case and the amount of work involved.  It is impossible to say whether the associate leaving the firm had anything to do with the attorney asking for costs now.   This attorney was willing to take a chance on your case by putting in his time and effort to get some money for you both.  He is asking you to contribute by paying some of the costs.  Not an unusual request.  If you don't like it, you could try and find another attorney to take your case."
1819051,"You should prepare a lodger agreement with your boyfriend and have him sign it.  The lodger agreement grants him use of the premises as a lodger, and gives you rights to summarily have him removed if the time comes and you need him out of your house.  This way he cannot claim some kind of cohabitation or domestic partnership exists.  This is an Australian version, but its sufficient to do the job quite frankly. A lodger is someone who rents your home while you live in it. A tenant typically has exclusive possession of the premises.

Even if the substance itself is not admissible. The officer can testify that you told him. In any interaction with the police you should keep two things in mind: (1) police can, do, and allowed to lie to you; and, (2) the only intelligent thing you can say to the police is that you are exercising your rights to silence and counsel. Then, be quiet.   Whether an attorney is competent has nothing to do with whether the attorney is a public defender. There are bad eggs in both camps. If you have the means to hire your own attorney, it's generally a good idea. That way you can vet them and make sure you get one you trust."
1826243,Generally employers must show they made a legitimate business decision to discharge the employee.

The debts you settle for less than what's owed will be reported as paid less than what's owed on your credit report, UNLESS you dispute the debt and make an offer in compromise, and the creditor agrees to report it as discharged through payment.  2. If you settle for less than what's owed, they will issue a 1099C for all amounts over $600 and you may owe taxes on the amounts not collected and paid.

1785620,"Illinois and most states deny benefits to employees in three situations: 1) if the unemployment is caused by the person going out on strike in a labor union situation (this is not you); 2) where the person voluntarily abandon's their job (except in certain limited circumstances) (again this is not you), and 3) where the employee has engaged in ""misconduct."" Misconduct means something really bad - like not following a safety rule, and doing something like theft, or embezzlement - something really awful. it sounds like they are going to assert the theft defense against you. So you will have to show that you did not steal anything and that employee theft was not the real reason you were terminated. That you were fired for some other reason - personality conflict, something along those lines."
1810370,"I am sure that a lot of the contract uses boilerplate terms and provisions already ""borrowed"" from other contracts, so most of it would not be subject to any sort of copyright.  Those which were specifically drafted to address a unique set of circumstances may arguably be subject to some sort of claim, but my experience is that you will only face a lawsuit if you copy the contract, formatting, logos, conceptual imagery and marketing look wholesale and pass it off as your own--in such circumstances, you are essentially stealing their branding and may cause consumers to confuse you with them.  You should meet with a lawyer and spend a little money to set yourself up and address the legal issues unique to your business where you wish to operate.  Then, you will end up with a contract all your own."

1824210,"What should you do?  Run, don‰Ûªt walk, to a maritime attorney.  Really!  You cannot afford to wait because there is a short period during which you can limit your liability to the value of your wrecked jon boat, motor, gear, and equipment.  That period started when you first received written notice that the ""buddy"" had a potential claim against you and that the amount of this claim could exceed the value of your wreckage.  Your question was posted at Green Cove Springs and asks about the St. Johns River.  Green Cove Springs is located on that river about half way between Jacksonville and Palatka.  The St. Johns River and its tributaries are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide all the way to Lake George just upstream of Palatka.  That makes it part of the navigable waters of the United States for Admiralty and Maritime Law purposes.  Even if the accident happened upstream of (south of) Palatka, the river is navigable in fact (thus part of the navigable waters of the United States) at least to Lake Harney where the NOAA/NOS navigation charts stop.  The lawyer letter you received is certainly enough to trigger the start of this period (be very certain to bring to your lawyer‰Ûªs attention anything else you may have gotten in writing from the ""buddy"" or anyone representing him).  Asking for your insurance information suggests to a reasonable person that the ""buddy"" is contemplating making a claim against you.  You wrote that your vessel ""was totaled"" and that the motor sat underwater for two weeks.  You did not mention lifejackets, fire extinguishers, or other gear or equipment (radio, fish finder, trolling motor, etc.).  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that ""soft tissue damage, pain, lost wages, and all kinds of other stuff"" will end up amounting to several times the scrap value of the wreckage and the fair market value of the waterlogged remainder.  A maritime attorney will know how to file an action for Limitation of or Exoneration from Liability; it can only be filed in the federal district court, as state courts do not have jurisdiction over limitation actions.  You will either have to surrender the vessel (and its gear, equipment, etc.) to the court, or post a bond equal to the value of the vessel after the allision.  (An allision is like a collision, but it involves striking a fixed object like a dock; a collision occurs when two vessels run into each other.)  The ""buddy,"" your neighbor (if his eye was injured), the dock owner, and everyone else who claims damages from this accident must bring them into this one proceeding or they are forever waived.  The judge, without a jury, will decide whether the accident was caused by negligence or fault.  If not, the case is over and you will not have to pay any damages.  If there was negligence or fault, then the judge will decide if you played some role in that (they call that privity or knowledge).  If not, your liability will be limited to the scrap value of the wreckage and the fair market value of the waterlogged remainder.  You absolutely must retain an attorney who is thoroughly knowledgeable and experienced in Maritime Law, one who can give you specific legal advice based on the particular facts and circumstances of your case. You can find such an attorney through the Florida Bar Association, the Southeastern Admiralty Law Institute, or the Maritime Law Association of the United States at the links below.  You can also use the ""Find a Lawyer"" link at the top of this web page."
1817362,"Unfortunately, without having all the specific details the answer is: ""probably not, but there is a possibility that you might be.""  Generally speaking, you are a resident of the state in which you are domiciled, which in plain English means where you have all your stuff and where you go to bed most nights.  However, under some very narrow circumstances it is possible to have two different states each treat you as a resident of that state.  The odds of that are very small, but if you're facing a situation where someone is claiming you're a resident of more than one state, then I would strongly urge you to consult with a competent tax attorney."

2077484,"This is a 'loaded' question, meaning it is frequently asked, and frequently answered in ways that can cause problems for people.  You are wise to reach out for some (hopefully) better information than you might get from your friends or co-workers, but you would be wiser still to speak personally with an experienced family law attorney in Oregon where you live.    I'm writing a response to you, even though I'm not an Oregon attorney, because of the obvious urgency and because this question is not necessarily something that depends on local law in Oregon, but rather, is handled in similar ways by most family law courts around the country.     First, Family law generally directs that parents are to follow valid custody orders, and that parents are the ones who have the responsibility for minor children, to see that the children's actions are consistent with the order.   If the Custody Order is wrong or mistaken, or out of date, it is the responsibility of the parent who believes it's wrong to return to the court with information and proper documentation to request a change in the order, rather than just ignoring the order.    But sometimes when there are emergencies, there's not a lot of time to go back to court, or because the process can be expensive, folks sometimes fail to do what they're ""supposed"" to do to change the orders (although now days there are forms online widely available to present requests to the court in the proper way, without an attorney).  What are referred to as ""refusal to visit"" cases with older kids represent some of the most difficult and contentious cases which family law courts and lawyers have to deal with.   ""Why"" a kid is refusing to visit is always the question, and the inherent difficulty in trying to make an older teen do something they don't want to do makes these cases especially tough.   If, as you seem to be saying, there are obvious safety issues for the kids, you may have grounds for an immediate Order or relief from the court along the lines of an ""Order of Protection"" or ""Protection from abuse Order"" which you should investigate immediately if you fear for your children's safety.  But more generally, if there's no safety problem, but rather, it's just kids who have become so oppositional that they won't visit at all, here's what I have seen in 30+ years of doing these cases.  Judges do not like the idea of giving kids ""the right to refuse visits"" and will not do that, typically.  They're reasoning is based on the fact that kids don't run the show.  One reason they shouldn't ""run the show"" is they can be easily manipulated, and putting them in the middle of parental conflict is a terrible idea, so asking or allowing them to ""refuse"" a visit is universally regarded as a bad idea.  But.  If a child is genuinely in danger, what should you as a parent do?   Certainly it is unlikely that any law enforcement agency is going to get involved, and no law enforcement agency that I've ever talked to is EVER going to take a child from one parent and forcibly give them to the other parent, without a SPECIFIC court order for that to occur (which does not exist in your situation).  Also, a parent who is legitimately seeking to protect a child from harm will normally  be able to avoid prosecution for the variety of statutes which exist in many states for what is called ""custodial interference.""   Plus, even if the dangerous parent is intent on getting law enforcement involved, the most that would be reasonably expected would be for them to cite or charge the parent who is allegedly not complying with the visitation.   And if that parent (you) can show they are protecting the children from harm by not sending them to visitation, as I say above, most prosecutors are not going to pursue that.    So, I realize this is a longer answer than what you may have expected, but I will close with a repeated request that you seek out and speak to an experienced family law attorney regarding this matter."

Only admissible evidence may be used at trial.  Having said that, if a party does not properly assert objections, said objections are waived.    The documents will be part of your Exhibit List at trial (unless used for impeachment), and you will use your witnesses, stipulations, discovery, etc. to lay proper foundation for the documents.    You should really consider consulting with an attorney, if not retaining one, as the simplest mistake may be fatal to your case at the MSJ or Trial stage."
1796842,"For any criminal prosecution to take place, a law enforcement agency needs to file charges against some or all of the individuals you are having an issue with.

That is a function of the criminal process involving the government. Other than reporting your issue to the police, you can possibly pursue a civil action against these individuals and ask for an injunction prohibiting further slanderous behavior etc. However,  these are not easy cases to pursue.

1797592,"This is going to depend on the specific terms of the lease, although generally a landlord is required to mitigate his or her damages from your breaking of the lease, by re-letting the premises.  This would suggest that your ""re-let"" fee will be charged where the landlord rents to someone else on equally or more favorable terms, but that you would not be charged for rent.  This is fairly typical.  However, if the landlord can't re-lease for the same or better terms, or it takes a while, you would generally be liable for the rent until such time as it is rented, or the end of your lease, whichever comes first - as well as the re-let fee.  But you might want to schedule a short consultation with a lawyer who can look at the document."

You might have to file an I-824 to have the case be converted.  The I-485 cannot be converted, that will be abandoned. Did they leave with advance parole?

You ARE correct in that under the existing regulations, an individual whose case has been deferred is eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action IF he or she can demonstrate ""an economic necessity for employment.""  Having said that, the question is ""do you have an economic need to be able to LEGALLY work in the United States?""    So far, these determinations appear to be made liberally, however, they are reviewed on a case by case basis, and there is never a guaranty.  Similarly, there are no statistics available on these types of adjudications.  As a result, there is no way to answer your question with specificity.  I always provide some documentary evidence with the work permit petitions (at least a written statement when there is no other documents - ex. a high school student supported by his parents)."
1790285,"Generally, an appraisal is exactly what the courts look to for a fair market value or a reasonable value.  If an independent and impartial appraisal is done, then that is the price at which a reasonable person would be willing to pay for the home, and that is what the Executrix can sell the home for.  Your personal feelings as to the value, whether sentimental or otherwise, have no impact on the value.  The value NOW in its current condition, not its potential value if fixed up would control.  If the appraisal seems too ridiculous, you may ask the Executrix for another appraisal to be done by someone of your choosing,, probably at your own cost.   If the appraisals differ greatly, then you may have a reason to ask the Executrix for a different valuation or notify the probate court.  The Executrix, if granted the power to sell the property, is adhering to her fiduciary duty to seek the best possible value by getting the appraisal.

If you have more 365 days of that and leave the country, you would be barred from reentering the USA for ten years, Canadian or not. Second, is the status violation. That gives the US government the reason to deny your entry even if you are not barred.

However, if you still need treatment, claim closure is not the way to go. I suggest you speak with an L&I attorney about your case to discuss your options. Also, if the Department has determined that you are able to work and your doctor disagrees, he or she needs to clearly state this in response.

1812898,"Actually, it was a relatively long nine year period of time, from 1997 until 2006, when there were no time limitations on prior offenses to constitute a felony DUI. From 1980 until 1997, there was a ""five-year look-back"" provision in the state‰Ûªs DUI law. When Act 97-556 was enacted to add a $100 additional assessment to all DUI convictions to fund the state‰Ûªs Impaired Driver Trust Fund, the words ""within a five year period"" were deleted from sub-sections dealing with third and fourth offenses. Shortly thereafter, third and fourth offense DUI arrests were prosecuted without reference to the time the previous DUI conviction had been entered. See, e.g., Ex parte Boyd, 796 So. 2d 1092 (Ala. 2001): No time limitation applied to prior DUI offenses for third and subsequent DUI arrests.   In 2006, the Alabama legislature re-wrote the Alabama DUI statute to reverse the Supreme Court‰Ûªs decision in Ex parte Bertram and added the new sub-section (o) that stated: ""A prior conviction within a five-year period for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs from this state, a municipality within this state, or another state or territory or a municipality of another state or territory shall be considered by a court for imposing a sentence pursuant to this section.""   Is there anything you can do about your felony record?  Possibly yes. You may be eligible, under certain conditions, to file a Rule 32 petition pursuant to Rule 32, Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, to attach the validity of your prior convictions. In the leading case of Ex Parte Bertram, 884 So. 2d 889 (Ala. 2003), the Alabama Supreme Court construed the term ""conviction"" as used in Code section 32-5A-191 to mean only convictions entered by a court within the state of Alabama, and specifically held that out-of-state DUI convictions could not be used for purposes of enhancement of sentence under Alabama‰Ûªs DUI statute then in effect. This line of reasoning was later applied to municipal court convictions. See, as example, Holbert v. State, 4 So. 3d 410 (Ala. 2008):  Holbert was part of the continuing litigation that originated from the Ex parte Bertram decision from the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003.  In Holbert, the defendant had four (4) prior DUI convictions - two of which occurred in a municipal court and two had been entered in a state district court. Holbert was subsequently indicted for felony DUI after his latest DUI arrest. Holbert then moved to dismiss the indictment for felony DUI based on the fact that two of the four underlying convictions were violations of a municipal ordinance and not violations of 32-5A-191. Applying the Supreme Court‰Ûªs legal analysis expressed in Ex parte Bertram, Holbert argued his prior offenses in the municipal court were not violations of ""this section"" as required by 32-5A-191 (h). Consequently, the felony in Holbert could not have reached the fourth offense requirement unless all three previous DUI convictions were entered in a state district court; municipal court convictions cannot, as a matter of law prior to the 2006 amendment, constitute prior convictions under 32-5A-191.   Your best course of action is to consult an attorney that is thoroughly familiar with Alabama DUI law and practice as well as post-conviction remedies."

1818958,"DO NOT PAY THE CIVIL DEMAND!  It has nothing to do with court.  This is most likely a violation of municipal ordinance and even if there is a court date, your ""child"" (how old is he?) will not go to jail. You need to consult with an attorney in the other state for more definite information.  There is law in most states, including the state of Illinois, which allows for civil action collection when there is a retail theft. Most people choose to ignore the demand. This demand is for money over and above any fine you pay in compliance with a court order. People may get a few more letters, each time asking for more, and then they stop. While the retailer can sue you, it is extremely rare for anyone to actually be sued. You do not owe any money unless you are sued and the retailer wins. This is a common ploy. Do not pay. If you do, you will be in the national retailers database which could affect your ability to get a job and could impact your life in other ways. If you are uncomfortable, hire a lawyer and have the lawyer write a cease and desist letter. That should be the end of it.   Here is a good article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120347031996578719.html   The National Retail Theft Database is actually a voluntary list put together by different individual retailers. Further, any member that published the information on the list, can thereafter, remove it. Therefore, if you wish to have the entry removed, as you apparently do, your best bet would be to write a letter to the manager of the particular store and inquire as to what it would take for them to remove the entry.

1806804,"If your landlord filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy without the inclusion of any non-exempt assets, that debt is likely discharged which means that you would not be able to pursue your security deposit claim against him. If your landlord filed for Chapter 13 or 11 bankruptcy petition, you may still not be able to pursue the claim depending on what income/assets he has and/or what plan he has for repaying his creditors.   For a more complete and comprehensive answer, you need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney who can gather all the facts and give you a targeted response based upon the type of bankruptcy your landlord filed."
1824139,"Let me try to add some insight. He was only married 3 years. What state did he marry in? Do they still live in the same state? What college degrees does he hold and what about her? What industry or what did he do for work, and what about her? Who earned more money? Did they both work? If he is working at Kroger then he must of had the mental capacity to understand what he was signing. Were they represented by an attorney, no, only her correct?  It sounds like he was not represented by the terminology you used. Like my colleague stated he might be stuck.

After that, Indiana will check your interstate driving record for any holds or suspensions.  Indiana will NOT issue you a driver's license while your license is subject to a suspension in another state.  Additionally, Indiana's hardship license statute would not help you, since they will only issue a hardship license to a person who has had a valid Indiana driver's license in the past.

1769051,"It's almost impossible to answer this question with the information provided.  First off, if he was sentenced as a youthful offender, the most he could do would be 4 years in prison, followed by 2 years probation or community control.  Additionally, youthful offenders are not subject to the 85% rule.  The Department of Corrections, whether youthful offender or not, determines any gain time and the out date for any inmate.  Youthful offenders can get out in as little as a year on a four year sentence in some cases.  Youthful offenders are treated specially.  Judges do not determine the length of stay in prison and, except in a few circumstances, cannot shorten it or lengthen it.  Wait till your boyfriend gets to prison and they will classify him.  At that time they will tell him his expected release date.  Attorneys are warned constantly to not tell their clients when they will get out, because they are almost always wrong."
1799581,"If he tries to suggest that you intentionally lost contact with him, the Judge is likely to ask him:  ""Well where have you been and what efforts have you made to make contact with the mother?""  This is a two way street and the phone works both ways.  I realize that he knows that the one thing that will get you upset is to threaten your child but a Judge will not turn over a child to an unknown person; a period of two years in the life of a child is huge.  If he wants to establish contact and develop a relationship, the Judge will order him to pay support as a condition.  If he has gone this long without paying support, he will not like that idea.  The Judge may also make some of the child support retroactive although if it was not decided before, the Judge may only make it into the future.  I would certainly consult with an experienced family law attorney about this situation.  Best of luck."
1801716,"The answer is:  it depends.  Alimony is subjective and totally dependent on the facts of each specific case.  Sometimes alimony is awarded on a  temporary basis -- to allow support to be made pending a suit for divorce -- and then sometimes it is also awarded beyond the trial.  In awarding what's called ""merits"" alimony, the court considers certain factors including: 1.  the ability of the parties seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting; 2.  the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment; 3.  the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage; 4.  the duration of the marriage; 5.  the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each of the party to the well-being of the family; 6.  the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties; 7.  the age of each party; 8.  the physical and mental condition of each party; 9.  the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party's needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony; 10.  any agreement between the parties; 11.  the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including: 12.,  all income and assets, including all property that does not produce income; any monetary award concerning property and award of possession and use of the family property 13.  the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and 14.  the right of each party to receive retirement benefits  All these factors will be taken into consideration by a court in determining whether to award alimony.

1826902,"Regrettably, this must be very uncomfortable for everyone.        It sounds like your parents have shown your sister their will(s) and she is unhappy with their decision on how to distribute their estate.  Have you had a talk with your parents about what your sister is saying?  Is it possible for everyone to come together in a spirit of honesty and civility so that this could get aired out?  (I realize that may be asking a lot!).  The point I'm trying to make is perhaps your parents have good reasons for their intent to distribute their estate that your sister doesn't understand.  It is possible they could explain it to her--it might not make her any happier but at least she'll have heard it from them first-hand.  It's also possible she may make some good points about her caregiving that your parents have overlooked or failed to consider.       All that being said, the other advice is correct:  the executor of someone's will cannot change the terms of the will once it's effective.  If she tries to pressure your parents to sign a new will, you may consider contesting the will's validity.  Good luck!"
1802125,"Courts are not in business to decide abstract questions.  They are there to decide cases.

In most cases the state attorney general would get involved only if the party you are suing is a state agency or employee.  Constitutional questions can be very tricky to advance, even trickier if you have a difficult procedural background to the case.  Please get counsel."

1819754,"You should file a motion for a continuance with your plea of not guilty.  However, there is no guarantee that the court will grant your motion for continuance.  If you hire an attorney, they should be able to enter an appearance on your behalf without your presence."
1795103,"Your post has several subparts. Assuming that was a written rental agreement, any violation of that written agreement, like not paying rent, is subject to a four-year statute of limitations. It would appear then that your former landlord still has about a year and a half before they must file suit. Many rental agreements require the tenant to provide a 60 day notice. The statute only requires a 30 day notice. There is no good case law on whether the 30 day  or 60 day notice Would be operative. The real issue here is the apparent failure of your former landlord to properly account to you for your security deposit, something which must be done within 21 days of the surrender of the apartment. That failure has given you the right to sue them for its return. This is all complicated by the fact you are now out of California, and the value of your suit and/or The value of their suit is not great enough to involve most attorneys. The proper court for this to take place, assuming this happened in Ontario, would be to San Bernardino County Superior Court located in downtown San Bernardino."

1813493,"False allegations against the other parent and emails showing proof of withholding the child are both strong indications that parental alienation is occurring.   It has to stop now.  It's probably best if you take a co-parenting class and complete it before the next court hearing.  You should also communicate in a business like manner at all times - especially emails and text messages as they are evidence.  The Court will give the child to the person who will be more likely to promote frequent and continuing contact with the other parent.  A strict custody sharing schedule is usually best in situations that are heated with exchanges occurring at a child care (am Mom drops off; pm Dad picks up) or at a 3rd party's home or place of business, or a police department.   Although you want full custody, you may have to settle for sharing custody.  It doesn't sound like your ex is bad enough to warrant losing custody and you stand a good chance of losing custody if you continue to alienate Dad.  Sorry, but all studies show children do best when they are able to have quality time with both parents (absent dangerous situations)."
1825895,"If you are asking whether you would be entitled to a divorce, in Ohio, the court of common pleas may grant divorces for the following causes:  (A) Either party had a husband or wife living at the time of the marriage from which the divorce is sought;  (B) Willful absence of the adverse party for one year;  (C) Adultery;  (D) Extreme cruelty;  (E) Fraudulent contract;  (F) Any gross neglect of duty;  (G) Habitual drunkenness;  (H) Imprisonment of the adverse party in a state or federal correctional institution at the time of filing the complaint;  (I) Procurement of a divorce outside this state, by a husband or wife, by virtue of which the party who procured it is released from the obligations of the marriage, while those obligations remain binding upon the other party;  (J) On the application of either party, when husband and wife have, without interruption for one year, lived separate and apart without cohabitation;  (K) Incompatibility, unless denied by either party."
1813595,"If you have been performing the same job, with the same responsibilities, the same hours and same pay, your income from working is averaged over the months that you work in the calendar year (http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-1574a.htm). This is because Social Security realizes that your some jobs, like your, will result in 3 pays for 2 months out of the year. So if the only reason you go over in one month is because of the extra pay, and not because of a change in hours, pay, or position, then your earnings are supposed to be averaged.  Now the important thing to remember is that the $1070 Substantial Gainful Activity Earnings limit does not go into effect until after you have used your trial work period. A trial work period is provided before Social Security looks to see if you have made Substantial Gainful Activity.   In 2014, you use one trial work month whenever you earn $770 or more from working. You have 9 trial work months in a 5 year period of time. If you have not yet used your trial work period, then you do not have to worry about Substantial Gainful Activity. If you still have trial work months left, it doesn't matter if you make $775 in a month, or $2000, you get to keep your Social Security benefit, and you have just used one trial work month. If you have already used all nine of trial work months, that is when you have to worry about Substantial Gainful Activity, which in 2014 is the $1070 per month you mentioned.  I would caution you, that even if you fit into the criteria to have your income averaged, you must still be careful. Social Security does not always properly apply its own regulations. You may be required to prove that your income should be averaged. You would do this by providing copies of all your pay stubs. Your pay stubs should show that you are working the same number of hours (or substantially the same) every pay period, your pay has not changed, and should demonstrate that there is no reason not to average.  I would recommend that to be careful, schedule an appointment with the Social Security Administration now, take in all your pay stubs for this year, and indicate that you are concerned you may have made too much money, but need to know if your income will be averaged. This should at least create a record that you have notified the Social Security Administration of the potential issue."
1808960,"A Workers' Compensation ""pretrial"" can be many things, and really depends upon the arbitrator and the attorneys as to how it is conducted.  They can be terribly informal--nothing more than asking the lawyers their sides of the case in about 30 seconds each (if that) and trying to evaluate the value of a case or determine how the arbitrator likely would rule on an issue.  Sometimes they involve the injured workers being present.  The most important thing to remember is that a pretrial is not a determination. NOTHING HAPPENS AT A PRETRIAL UNLESS THE PARTIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS AGREE TO IT.  A judge/arbitrator might suggest that he/she would rule against you or for you at a pretrial.  Let's say the arbitrator thinks, based upon the brief recital of possible evidence, that he will likely find your case should not be denied.  That may spur the Respondent employer to begin paying you benefits.  Then again, it might mean the employer tells you or your attorney to take a hike.  If that happens, you'll likely have to go to trial to try to prove your case.  If you have a lawyer, I suggest you contact them to discuss what might occur at a pretrial and why the case is being denied, as well as the likelihood of winning."

Again, generally, contact information must be exchanged unless there is express language to the contrary. If after your review of your parenting plan you determine that your ex-husband is violating the plan, which is a court order, you should take him to court on contempt/enforcement.  Good luck!"

The best advice would be to go complete the requirements and obtain a valid license as soon as possible, hopefully before court. Many courts and prosecutors are understanding when a person does what is necessary to obtain license and brings proof so as to drive lawfully. Hopefully, the case can then be dismissed. It is also prudent to consult with a good local defense attorney, who can likely handle such a simple case at very modest cost. The lawyer can likely resolve the case favorably. God luck."

Under 17 USC 101 a work based on a copyrighted work is a ""derivative"" work and under 17 USC 106, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to make derivative works, and violation of that exclusive right is copyright infringement under 17 USC 501 for which there can be serious damages.

But naming ALL the forms you will need ,and where to find them, and explaining how to fill them out is beyond the scope of an AVVO short answer.   Call the other side a FULL 24 hours in advance and advise them when, where, and what time the hearing.  You cannot make the phone call, it must be a 3rd party.  If the other side is represented call his/her attorney not the party. Call the court clerk for the hours the court is currently hearing expartes.  After the call, the 3rd party must write a declaration about the notice they gave.  In the declaration on page three of the RFO you must state (1) what it is you are asking for, (2) good reason for asking it, AND (3) why it must be heard on an emergency basis - why it cannot be heard with a standard 3 weeks notice to the other side.  Show up at the courthouse on the hearing and see the clerk just past the xray machine who will tell you where to go next.   Have 3 extra copies of your forms with you for the clerk.

1808470,"Unless your motion is a total dud (in which case you wouldn't have brought in the first place), I would NEVER waive oral argument, especially on a motion that I took the time and expense to prepare and file.  Just because the tentative is against you doesn't mean you'll lose.  There are many reasons for a tentative to go against you.  Perhaps the person who worked up the motion missed an important case cited, or misunderstood an important point of law and/or fact.  Or one of the papers you filed never found its way to the judge.  Those things happen all the time.  Many times I have arrived in court for a hearing to find a tentative ruling against me, that I was able to reverse through oral argument.  Judges today are overworked, with large caseloads and light staff.  Go into oral argument and, at minimum, press the main points of your motion.  That alone may cause the judge to see the matter differently.  It may also invite discussion into the finer points of your motion that might have been missed during the court's preparation for the hearing.  If nothing else, it will give you an opportunity for some face time with the judge, as well as an opportunity to 'tell your story' and remind your judge what your case is all about.  That's very valuable in the big picture.  No matter what the final outcome will be at the hearing, I believe you absolutely should appear and argue your motion.  Let's face it, the tentative is against you so have nothing to lose and everything to gain by appearing."

Requiring a license has consistently and repeatedly been ruled to not be a violation of the right to travel.  There is a lot of information on the Internet on how to argue the unconstitutionality of the State's requiring a license.  They usually contain lots if case quotes.  The problem is these arguments usually take quotes out of context or come from cases that are not relevant. More importantly, as far as I know none of these arguments have been presented successfully.  I'm not saying that there's not a good argument against the constitutionality of required drivers licensing.  I'm just saying that I've seen many angles argued but no winners."

1806812,"Compelling one to support a religious enterprise, or to attend its services, when one does not share the tenets and teachings of that religion, is tyrannical.  It attacks an essential aspect of human liberty protected against infringement by the government by the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution.  The insistence on attending services, coupled with the dire consequence of confinement in the hole, is the essence of coercion.  And coercion is at the heart of most clear and direct violations of the Constitution.  I think that pursuing an action against County and those officers responsible is something to consider.  At the same time, I would not forget that the enterprise of suing others can be expensive, difficult, and not always rewarding.  In the case of these kinds of violations, however, there are federal statutes, the Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act, that make it possible, if you prevail, to recover the costs of the suit.  I would recommend contacting the ACLU in Ohio or the Rutherford Institute.  I've included links for both below.  Both work on issues related to religious freedom, and, of course, the ACLU maintains a program regarding prisoners' rights."

1829660,"The short answer is maybe, depending on family code å¤ 4320 factors. You were married 13 years, which is considered a marriage of long duration entitling a spouse to potentially lifetime spousal support. But, you could argue against it and a court may be receptive. For example, you were separated 7 years ago, divorced for five and she did not need spousal support during those years. You can argue she became self-supporting alleviating the need for spousal support. Being separated for 7 years, when you were married for 13, means she has not received spousal support for over half of the duration of your marriage. There may be a chance that you will not have to pay spousal support. Contact an attorney most will give free consultations. Good luck with you case."
1791752,"I think that many people wrongly assume that there are magic documents that will persuade USCIS/State to issue visas and determine that relationships are bona fide.To me it seems like there are good reasons why you don't have a joint bank account now.  It also seems like you'll be able to document your relationship in a number of different ways (photos, letters from friends and family, the bank statements you mention). My advice to persons filing I-130s is that they should arrange their married lives in a way that makes sense to them and not necessarily to satisfy immigration authorities.    To make sure that the case is well prepared and presented, I strongly recommend working with an immigration attorney throughout the duration of this process.  Alex"

1810994,"If you were rear ended it is not going to be an argument about who is at fault.  The argument is going to be about the amount of damages.  Insurance companies have a deliberate and carefully orchestrated plan to minimize how much they will pay out and it starts with the adjuster for the other car calling you and saying she or he is so sorry to hear about your injuries and they will take care of you - all you need to do is give them a statement and sign some documents so they can view your medical records.  This is a trap designed to carefully document your post accident progress in a way that most favors the insurance company (for the other driver).  Their goal is to pay you as little as possible.  They play on your emotions so you think they are being helpful and you will cooperate with whatever they ask for.  Every case they can lowball means more profits for them and means they can throw up statistics at attorneys like myself to tell us our future cases aren't worth anything.  In the early 1980's I used to get offers of $10,000 pretty regularly to settle soft tissue injury cases like yours.  Now 30 years later I am lucky if I can offers of more than $1,500 to $3,000 and the insurance company will battle like crazy to avoid paying a dime more.  We PI lawyers fight vigorously to stop the trend of low ball offers and are willing to take cases up on appeal when necessary to protect the legal rights of consumers like yourself.  We fight for new laws that protect your rights by hiring lobbyists and going head to head with the well paid insurance lobbies every legislative session.  So by hiring a PI lawyer, preferably on that is a member of the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association (just ask) you will not only get a better settlement then you would on your own, even after paying a percentage as attorney fees, you will also stand up for your rights and the rights of other accident victims to get a fair and full settlement.  Understand that you have PIP coverage under your own insurance policy.  This is a no-fault additional to your policy so what the other insurance company does or thinks doesn‰Ûªt effect your right to this coverage nor will using it effect your insurance rates. This will pay for your medical treatment up to $15,000 and up to a year of treatment.  If you need to take time off of work, you may qualify for the lost wages that PIP will pay which is additional.   Your PI lawyer will see to it that you take full advantage of your PIP coverage, so you can get the treatment you need and your lost wages while you recover.  You should not even consider settling your case until your injuries resolve.  You have up to two years before a case would needs to be filed in the court so this is usually enough time to allow your recovery period before trying to settle.  As for car damages, if you have full coverage you can address the car repair or replacement by using your full coverage.  If you have a deductible you may need to pay it but it will be reimbursed later on.  If you don't have full coverage, a fairly new law (lobbied for by OTLA), now requires that the other driver's insurance company make you a fair offer immediately for the amount of your repairs or the replacement value of your car.  Your PI attorney can help you facilitate this.  Just don't be deceived that the other insurance companies willingness to settle your car damages is due to anything other then the fact that they are now obligated to do this under Oregon Law.  It is not a sign that your case will be settled easily without legal representation.  In fact, if they try to total your car they still play all sorts of games trying to argue that your car isn't worth much. Your PI lawyer should be able to help you establish the fair market value of your car if it is totaled."

1790109,"I have had several issues with cars being in accidents that were not initially reported or never reported on car history reports like carfax and autocheck.  I would advise you to get the reports from both of them and then to call the companies about the issue.  If you relied on a carfax report at the time of your purchase, you may qualify for a payment or repurchase of the car under the carfax buyback guarantee.  You could also have a claim against the dealership if the dealership gave you the carfax.  Some dealerships buy cars knowing that they have damage, fix the damage in house without reporting it, and knowingly misrepresent the vehicle's history using an inaccurate report when they try to sell it.  Other times the dealership doesn't know of the damage, but still may be legally responsible if you relied on statements they made about the vehicle's history when you purchased it and those statements turned out not to be true."

As a general answer, all I can say is that mom should not leave the country without first obtaining an ""Advance Parole"" travel document, since if she does, am afraid everything could be deemed ""abandoned"" and she will not be able to come back to the US - ever.  Her children cannot ""get a visa"" for her, since to be readmitted she will need to file a ""Hardship Waiver"" to ""waive"" the 10 years inadmissibility bar she will be triggering upon her departure, due to the more than 20 years of ""unlawful presence"" she accrued here.

This is considered an ineffective assistance of counsel defense.  But, it also seems to me this is a misdemeanor or infraction case and maybe your damages are minimal. I do not know.  But that said you can move to vacate the plea agreement if you are able to prove you were coerced into it. But from my experience most judges question you about the voluntariness of the plea and unless you complained on the record, its possible you may be shut out of revoking the plea deal.  A PD can be held liable for legal malpractice, again its something you need to talk to another lawyer about.

1813734,"We would need a few more facts to be able to provide more detailed guidance.   The items you listed are: 1. Your dad's burial plot. This is an excluded item per section 440.5 of the Medicaid Long Term Care  Handbook. So it is okay to purchase a plot.  2. Add more money to the prepaid funeral. If the amount in the prepaid funeral is more than 125% of the local average cost of a funeral you may run into some problems. Ask the local County Assistance Office what their limit is on pre-paid funeral allowances. For example, Montgomery County is $15,000.00 and Lehigh is $12,500.00 so it changes based on each county. Try to make sure the prepaid funeral stays within the county limits as the CAO will review it.  3. Mother's headstone. Technically no, you can not use it for your mother's headstone. While this may seem harsh under Medicaid rules, it is important to understand that the CAO will look at what he spent the money on. If your parents will be buried together after your father passes and he happens to get a stone to mark his grave, that would be perfectly acceptable. The intent is what counts. If you intend it for your father and it is for him, then it is okay. If you happen to later on add otehr inscriptions to the stone that is your choice, but the initial purchase must clearly be for the benefit of your father. Beware - if you covered his stone or costs in the prepaid funeral you can not go ahead and pay again a second time. The CAO checks for these things.   I know that answer on the marker is not necessarily what you want to hear, but it is important to understand you do not want to take any action that causes eligibility issues for your father. If the stone is not that costly it would not likely cause and long term problems, but you have to understand that the paperwork involved in the determination could be endless and cause more stress to your family that simply finding a different way around it.   Sorry to bring this type of news to the discussion.   I hope this answer helps."

1789129,"This is a good question. If you were charged with a felony, you are exposed to a sentence of imprisonment of over one year. If you're charged with a misdemeanor or several misdemeanors, you are subject to a sentence of up to one year in the local county jail, per charge or count.  The judge is legally empowered to give you consecutive prison terms if your cases are felonies, or consecutive jail terms if your cases involved misdemeanors.   Consecutive means one year followed by another year. Thus, if you are convicted of five first-degree misdemeanors, you can conceivably serve five years consecutively in the local county jail, and never go off the state prison. Further, this does not make you a felon nor do you lose your civil rights as would a convicted felon.  Florida statutes define what crimes are classified as felonies and what crimes are misdemeanors. Just because you serve five or ten years consecutively on multiple misdemeanors, does not make yours a felony conviction."

1800919,Just because the debt has been charged off and the SOL has run doesn't mean that you do not owe this debt anymore. This common misconception happens all the time. You can attempt to settle the debt so that it is reported as satisfied on your credit report instead of outstanding. You can wait until the debt eventually drops off of the report since you do not have to worry about a lawsuit if the debt is really past the SOL. Or you can attempt to dispute the accounts listed on your credit report with the respective credit bureaus if you feel that they are being improperly reported. The bureaus may even remove some of these accounts.

1811269,"With a trial date of August 25, your discovery cut-off (e.g., your discovery completion date) is 30 days before the trial date, or July 26.  Discovery is deemed ""complete"" when both the requests AND their responses have been served within statutory time limits.  Assuming from your facts that the document demand was served by mail on June 25, you would have a total of 35 days from the date the demand was served to respond (30 days plus five additional days for service by mail) which means your deadline to respond is July 30, four days AFTER the discovery completion deadline.  The inspection demand is untimely because it cannot be completed (e.g. served and responded to) on or before the July 26 discovery completion deadline.  Therefore you need not respond.  Out of an abundance of caution, however, you may wish to serve a general objection to the demand as untimely.  Best of luck to you."

There probably is an issue as to whether or not there is insurance to cover the acts of your fiancee, possibly homeowners coverage ( if available). A claim against the ballpark would have to prove the ridge that cased the fall was due to a defect, such as design, construction or not readily visible, as determined by a safety expert. The ball park may claim that there was no defect, or if so, it was open and obvious."

1791877,"Trademark rights arise from use in commerce, not registration.  A trademark is enforceable even if it is not registered.  Thus, if you found someone else using the trademark o n Etsy, and if you would be competing with this company or person in the same industry, geographic area, and/or for the same customers, you could be liable for trademark infringement because your use would create consumer confusion.   You are the junior user even if this other company did not  yet apply for trademark protection.  Thus, your best bet if you want to avoid a law suit is to find another brand name.  Of course, you can try to register the name and use it---and you might get away with it.  But the risk is very high----unless you have a large war chest for litigation, it is not a risk you should take."

1815012,"Tricky situation.  Oregon and Washington have entered into a reciprocal agreement whereby the state in which a person is HIRED TO WORK has jurisdiction.  Although the intent was to simplify things, it really doesn't.  If your sister's husband was hired in Oregon to work in Oregon and other states, he probably is an Oregon worker.  Though I usually don't advise this, it might be prudent to file in both states.  Also, heart attack claims are extremely difficult to prove.  Just because he was at work doesn't automatically establish that his work was a cause of the heart attack.  You should have your sister consult with competent Washington AND Oregon attorneys to sort out the situation.  Don't delay as Oregon has a fairly short time to file a claim.

However, there might be a lot of other employer requirements inside the contract which haven't been met which could give you some relief.   You do need a lawyer to review your paperwork to figure that out.  Another consideration is given that you have only worked there for a couple of days, I would doubt that the employer has yet to provide much training, access to their customer lists, etc.   These are usually the kinds of stuff employers are seeking to protect when they make people sign non-competes.  If you haven't seen or used any of these things yet, maybe you could simply confirm that with the employer, quit and ask to be relieved of any obligations to the extent you have any.  A good lawyer can navigate you through all this."

1809413,"As other attorneys have correctly noted in this forum, federal firearms laws (18 U.S.C 922(g)) bar almost all convicted felons from possessing firearms, and because it is a federal statute, the ban applies in all states. Most states also have their own laws concerning felons in possession of firearms, so unfortunately, a person could face problems if confronted by either state or federal law enforcement. In some cases, even a restoration of rights or certificate of rehabilitation under a state's laws may not remove the federal ban.

That said, none of us has a crystal ball. If you were contacted by them accusing you of infringement, you would be wise to consult your own lawyer in private who can offer a proper analysis of the situation once all the facts are understood and create a best course of action. If you are contacted by law enforcement or anyone else for that matter, say nothing until you receive the advice of your own attorney.

295091,"A drug dog alert provides probable cause for a longer detention than normally would have been allowable.  However, once the dog alerts, there are two choices - detain you and your vehicle while a warrant for search is obtained from a judge, or just go ahead and perform the search knowing that if anything is found it may be suppressed because there was no warrant.  Some cops are such cowboys that they cannot wait even for a judge to sanction what they intend to do and blunder ahead.  Suppression, if something is found, is the imperfect method for teaching cops like that to not be cowboys, that citizens have rights they cannot infringe.  In cases where the cowboys come up empty, the citizen is left without recourse unless they take action on principle.  I would certainly see a local civil rights attorney who can examine all the facts involved here - such situations are so exactingly fact specific that to say anything without all the facts would be foolhardy, and who can research the latest case law on vehicle searches under these or similar circumstances.  At the very least you may be entitled to have your vehicle repaired and maybe you can help teach the police to think twice before going ahead without the sanction of a warrant.  As a side note - consider that they had sought a warrant.  It would have likely been granted and the search proceeded.  In such a case their action would have been insulated by judicial immunity and you probably would have been out of luck.   See an attorney, get a repair estimate for your truck, and good luck."
436914,"You really need to speak with a lawyer directly to try to get exact answers on what is going on; I'll answer as best as I can based on what information is here:  1) Very good question - it makes no sense for them to do this absent a showing that you committed fraud in first getting conditional permanent residence.  Your ex may have written to USCIS and made some form of accusation.  No real way to know.  2) No - not right now.  terminated means they're over, ""without prejudice"" means that it wasn't a decision on the merits and ICE can bring the case again later.  Most likely, if the I-751 is denied.  3) If they did formally terminate your conditional permanent residence status, then there is nothing to extend.  HOWEVER, approved of an I-751 would still grant unconditional permanent residence status.  4) I wouldn't until this is cleared up.  There is relatively recent guidance - a few months back - that removal proceedings should be terminated this way when an agency adjudication (such as USCIS determining your I-751) might solve the problem (I'm paraphrasing a bit).  Speak with an attorney, bringing all of your paperwork, to try to figure this out."
1509963,"I live and work in California and deal with accidents like yours all the time, so I am happy to answer your question. I would speak to your lender and have them get in contact with your insurance adjustor.  Usually the proper way is to continue making payments to the lender and then seek reimbursement through the insurance company.  However, with this route you are assuming that you or the other other party have adequate coverage to cover your payments in addition to rental coverage etc. With that being said you have a lot of rights as a pedestrian and I would make sure that you hire a lawyer.  I've handled cases and referred clients to great doctors in the San Jose, CA area.   At our firm we always refer people to all kinds of doctors and chiropractor and our clients never pay anything upfront, not even a copay. The doctors are willing to do this because an attorney is on board. You are entitled to have your property damage, medical bills and future medical expenses PAID FOR BY THE OTHER PARTY'S INSURANCE. The attorney you hire will handle the claims process from start to finish.   But you are going to need to see a specliast to even get a shot at getting future medical treatment from the Defenedant. Moreover it sounds like the accident is completely the other persons fault so you don't want this case to become a difficult one because of lack of inattention. The insurance company will make you believe that your case is worth very little... Regarding pain and suffering, you need to speak to an experienced attorney that can strategize your case. Just because you were in an accident doesn't mean you have pain and suffering, at least thats what the insurance companies think. Make no doubt about it you have a great case, but you need help from a professional. You are entitled to your medical bills being covered as well.   Do you feel that you are at the same medical condition that you were before the accident? As a basic premise I wouldn't handle your claim by yourself. The attorney you hired can likely refer you to a doctor, if you ask for one, who will see you with no upfront payment! I've done this many times to help my clients out. You should not wait a single day to hire a lawyer, we will advise you on the strategy of your case. There is no upfront cost to hire an attorney.   With a case like yours it seems like you have some good facts in order to get a high settlement, but your case definitely needs to be developed further to corroborate your story. The most important thing when building your case are: liability (were you at fault); how bad are your injuries to your body. A lot of these things sound like they are not complete yet in your case so its something that is worth hiring an attorney for in order to get a sense of whether you have a case and what the strategy would be for you to build a strong case! I've handled cases and/or spoken to clients in the San Jose, CA area.   Its very possible that your case is worth more than the $$$ that the insurance company will offer you by yourself. Make your life easier and call an attorney today, you won't regret it."

1820034,"If USCIS requests information or documents and they are not provided, your application will probably be denied. If you divorce, there may be consequences depending what stage you are in your application. If the divorce happens before conditional residence is granted, it will be denied. If divorce happens  when you already have conditional residence but before the condition is removed, you will be able to file an I-751 waiver to remove the condition on your own.   If eventually your green card is denied, you will face a lifetime ban from applying for any visa if there is a finding of marrieage fraud. If it is denied because you didn't meet your burden of proof and did not establish thst the marriage was genuine, you may still file for other visas in the future."
1788116,the immigration court process is usually long. and there can be some good outcomes if she diligently attends all hearings. Court sounds terrifying. but immigration court is often much easier - ex judges and others on this forum might want to comment further.  I have clients who go to their court dates regularly and have been doing so for a number of years. And it's just a part of their life. Why do it? Because she may become eligible for some immigration benefit down the line - it happens a lot - and that is completely messed up if someone has had an order placed in their absence because they skipped their court hearing. I'm delighted they are no longer in those crowded centers. It must have been very stressful for you.

1817967,"At common law, if a lawyer's services are involuntarily terminated, he or she could file a charging lien.  If the lawyer withdrew from the case, then the lawyer may or may not be entitled to reasonable value of services rendered.  The lien is not an order or judgment. So no due process is involved until the court hears the lien and then decides whether the lawyer is entitled to the lien, and if so, the amount. So there is a legal issue and a factual issue, both of which are decided at a later time.  Consider the lien a motion or petition to the court. All that is required is service of it on you, and at some point a notice of hearing on it."
1825383,Who told you that you don't have to say you were arrested? I find that odd given that you plead guilty to something.

It sounds like you may have a valid FDCPA claim - the creditor is attempting to collect a debt that is not valid.  You may also have a FCRA case if you dispute the incorrect reporting on your credit reports, and it is not removed.  I would seek an experienced FDCPA/FCRA attorney in your area and get a consult.  You don't need to suffer through this alone anymore.  Both statutes I've mentioned provide attorney's fees, so if the attorney feels confident about your case, he or she may take it without charging you upfront.  Best of luck to you.  Hang in there!"
1816935,"When a person dies, their estates may be handled under a Will through the probate process; under a trust in accordance with the death distribution provisions of the trust, or, where there are both probate and trust assets, by both methods. In the probate area, there can be litigation over a multitude of matters: Will contests, issues about who can be PR, whether all the property has been inventoried, whether the PR is doing the right thing, whether an accounting is accurate, etc. Some attorneys will handle minor litigation issues in the Orphans' Court, but would not consider a Will contest jury trial in the Circuit Court, much less an appeal to one of our appellate courts. If an attorney indicates ""contested wills"" I would expect that attorney to be willing and able to handle a Circuit Court jury trial. But, that's not necessarily true because Martindale allows us to pick the categories. The solution is for you to ask the lawyer. A contested trust issue goes to the Circuit Court. So, I expect that an attorney who lists that, would have no hesitation to do either a contested probate (Will) or trust matter. I think ""contested wills"" would in most instances be a subset of ""conested trusts and estates"" as would ""probate litigation"" I expect some attorneys would consider ""contested wills"" to be a subset of ""probate litigation"" and some would consider it wholly different. Many ""litigation"" attorneys handle probate and trust litigation but you'll find that very few concentrate (we MD attorneys cannot ethically us the word ""specialize"" except for limited practice areas) their practice in that field. There are many differences between an Orphans' Court and the Circuit Court. Simply put, the litigation that occurs in the Orphans' Courts is generally far simpler with relaxed (and sometimes) no rules of evidence. (Many MD Orphans' Court judges are lay people without legal training). Your 4th question is the most difficult because it depends upon the lawyer - some would say yes to all areas and some would say yes to fewer than all and ask which court. Once you've selected at least 3 candidates, I suggest you call each and ask them for their experience. Also keep in mind that there is far more to selecting an attorney than simply experience. The chief complaint by clients to disciplinary bodies about their attorney is lack of communication. An attorney well experienced in all of these fields who is a bad communicator would lkiely be a bad choice."

Asylum may be a possibility if you can prove that you were a victim of sex crimes due to a protected asylum class such as political opinion, race, or religion.  For instance, if you were raped because you opposed the prime minister's political party, that would likely be a solid asylum claim.  I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney who can review your case in more detail and advise you whether asylum would be worth pursuing.  Best of luck."

1799179,"It sounds as though there are a few steps missing in the information you provided.  In order for a garnishment to be put in place the collection agency would have had to file a lawsuit against you to collect the money for the medical bills.  You would have been served a summons and complaint and given an opportunity to file a response with the court and request a trial in front of the judge.  If you ignored the summons then the collection agency would have been granted a default judgment for the amount requested, and that is what would have allowed them to proceed with garnishment.  The time to dispute your responsibility for the medical expenses would have been in court.  Depending upon the amounts involved, you may want to consider meeting with a bankruptcy lawyer to determine whether that might be a reasonable solution for you."
1827827,Mr. LeRoi is correct.   You need to consult with a family law attorney to have a discussion and full opportunity to ask all of the questions you have.  The history you present makes a very strong case for either supervised contact or no contact at all until he repairs some of his damaged abilities.  You may need a strong advocate on your side to give the best opportunity to protect both yourself and your child.
1790656,"There is information I need to accurately answer this question.  However, since you did not mention an order regarding custody I am going to assume that neither party has established custody or visitation in court.  As such, yes, she can take the children and so can you.  Until the court establishes which party is entitled to custody (often it is both) and sets a visitation schedule then there are no hard and fast rules.  However, if the children have been living with you it is likely that Oklahoma is their home state and ""taking"" the kids could be considered kidnapping in certain circumstances.  In either case, you need to get an attorney and file a divorce/paternity action.  The second part of your questions asks whether or not she can get child support when she does not have the kids.  The answer is probably not but it depends on what you mean by ""does not have the kids.""  Child support is calculated according to a formula. based on the number of overnight visits and the income of the parties (among other factors).  If you have the children more often than not, the other party should be held responsible for child support."

The only way to really know what your physical injuries are is to be examined by a physician.  If it is your neck that is hurting you, you maybe should see an orthopedic surgeon.  You may also want to get a consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon.  If the accident happened within the last 14 days and you have PIP insurance you may have up to $10,000 available to you (of course you may have a % of responsibility and deductible) for treatment.  When you make an appointment with an attorney to discuss, make sure you take them copies of the police report, any pictures that you have taken of your injuries and property damage, and any medical records regarding any treatment that you have received for your injuries. This is so the attorney can fully evaluate your case.  I wish you the best of luck."
1789496,"Buying a home at a foreclosure auction is certainly a risk. There is the possibility of liens being attached to the property and the new titleholder becomes liable for the liens. Utility liens are generally superior to the mortgage foreclosure case and surive, but it's hard to tell without seeing the lien itself.  As far as the HOA lien, Florida Statute 720.3085 is where to look. There you will find that 720.3085 (2)(a) states ""A parcel owner, regardless of how his or her title to property has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure sale or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all assessments that come due while he or she is the parcel owner.""

1819860,I think we need some more facts here.  It could be that you are being discriminated against due to your disability but there would have to be a pattern of this type of behavior being exhibited.  I would speak with a lawyer about your case.
1828533,"There is no way to answer this question with the information you have provided. Only your lawyer has a firm enough grasp on all the facts to advise you as to whether settlement is advisable. As a general rule, though, you should know that class action lawsuits seldom result in significant substantive relief to the class members.  As a separate matter, the prosecution of a class action lawsuit tends to be very lengthy and very expensive. If your attorney is not in a position to fund the litigation, your odds of success are pretty low. And getting another attorney to take the case over may be difficult or impossible.  One last thing - you say that the settlement involves ""a lot of risk for the class and me."" But that statement seems to ignore the risk on the other side of the equation: that is, the risk you will lose. Even if you have a good case on the merits, you have to win a class certification motion. And those motions are denied far more often than they are granted.  You need to have a frank discussion with your attorney regarding why he is recommending this settlement and what the result will be if it is accepted. But you also need to look at your claims from a very practical perspective. If you fail to obtain a class certification, if you fail to prevail on the merits, or if the costs of suit exceed the amount ultimately recovered from the landlord, you will be even worse off than if you accepted a settlement."

1806826,"Hello,  Once you marry and apply for adjustment of status based on the marriage, if you also apply for employment authorization, you can use that employment authorization to obtain a social security card and use both of those documents to sign up at your local DMV office for the driving test.  However, you would need to take and pass the test and obtain your license in order to drive here legally (unless you have an international license that continues to be valid, and even then, there are risks involved in using an international license when actually living in the U.S.).    The employment authorization generally takes about 4 months to get, though, as you first must have your biometrics appointment (fingerprints and digital photo), and then it may take up to an additional 90 days beyond that appointment.  Thus, some of my clients end up receiving their appointment for their residency interviews before they actually get their licenses.  So yes, it's possible to get a driver's license while your residency application is pending, but it also is possible that you might complete the residency process before you have time to complete the licensing procedures and requirements.

1826532,"The most important thing to understand about Probation Violations is that the offender does not have the same rights as when they are charged with a crime.  Probation violations are considered ""post conviction"" issues and offenders actually have very few rights.  They can often be stuck in jail waiting to see a judge for a long time as the law does not mandate timeframes for probation violators.  The law simply says that they must see a judge in a reasonable amount of time, which can be defined very loosely in some counties.  So, it may be 10 -12 weeks before they get in front of a judge (which happens in my county all the time).  Also, once in front of a judge, it is critical to understand that several things can happen and it is all up to the judge to decide how they want to handle the situation.  First of all, the offender can lose their first offender status because it is a privilege that can be revoked.  This would mean that he could be convicted if the courts revokes this status.  Second, it does not matter how much probation is left on his original sentence.  Even though the Prosecutor negotiated 5 years in the plea negotiations and the Judge accepted those negotiations at the initial plea, the risk of taking first offender and violating is that if they violate, teh judge could sentence the offender to the maximum sentence for the charges which the offender plead guilty.  So, if his initial charges total 25 years as a max sentence, the judge could sentence him to exactly that.  This is rare for first time probation violators, but it is how it works.  He needs a lawyer to expedite a court date, to try to preserve his first offender status to prevent a conviction, and to try to keep him from being sentenced to something more severe than the original sentence.  Best of luck to you both."

It is not clear that you have any obligation to your ex-spouse but it would be prudent to list them as a potential creditor.  The bankruptcy will discharge your obligation to the third parties and as long as any debt you have to your ex-spouse is not ""in the nature of support"" and they do not object to the discharge of any potential obligation, your bankruptcy will discharge any debt to them as well.  There is the potential for an objection by your ex-spouse which could create a situation where the burden of proof could shift to  you regarding any hardship created by the discharge of debt to your ex-spouse.

It is unlikely that the judge will allow you to stop paying support prior to 23, but you must answer your ex-wife's complaint and file a counterclaim, which then must be served with the answer. Also, the fact that you have taken additional financial burdens will have no real weighing on the case, and if you owe back support, you will continue to owe it.

That being said, the penalty on the lender for not doing a form 1099-c is $50 if they're caught. So raising your offer by $50 should be more than enough to get them to decline to issue one. A recitation that the debt was doubtful and disputed inserted into the settlement agreement should be enough to immunize both sides from any further inquiry.   Remember, it's a hassle for them to prepare it and issue it ... they're hard to figure correctly and the collectors that actually issue them are usually large Junk Debt Buyers that the IRS watches closely, or collectors that you have annoyed mightily so that they do it on a retaliatory basis.

When you break a lease, you are responsible for paying damages.  However, your landlord has a duty to mitigate his damages.  If he is able to find a new renter at a higher rent, he is not out any money and can't charge you the other $1,000.  The other attorney is speaking of liquidated damage clauses.  This is a part of some contracts, but not all.  It basically is a way for damages to be calculated early, instead of waiting until the damages occur and having to calculate them later.

980961,"BBS, like all other California licensing agencies, has a statutory right and power to deny an MFT (or any other)  license based on improper conduct or conviction of any crime. A ""wet reckless"" is a crime for these purposes. Further, CA licensing agencies can deny a professional license based on improper conduct that does not result in conviction, or is not criminally prosecuted, although the agency's procedural burden is higher where there is no conviction.   There is substantial useful info on this issue available to you on the BBS web-site. I encourage you to read the Disciplinary Guidelines and terms and conditions of license probation (drug and alcohol conditions) carefully, and also to read through several years of BBS license denials (decisions are on-line).  That info gathering will give you a sound idea of the scope of your problem here.  Your internship can be terminated based on this offense, although I would not necessarily expect that to occur.   In all events, when you prepare your application for license, you will need to disclose this matter and to provide a full narrative statement of the underlying facts and circumstances of the offense. Take great pains with the narrative statement. The Board is looking for a very specific and particular kind of insight and information there. As to whether the Board will deny the license based on this conduct, each case is judged on the individual merits of the facts and the applicant. You may want to consult with an attorney who practices professional licensing law for assistance in preparing the strongest possible application to overcome this issue.

If you improved the house at all you may have claims for repayment of the increase in value. Getting around the Statute of Frauds is difficult, we have a trial on this very matter in two weeks and even with good evidence the outcome is not likely to be fully favorable.

Many attorneys handle these cases on a contingency percentage fee, taking a percentage of the recovery.

1813365,"You have received very good answers already. I will only try to shed some light on actually getting your portion of a retirement plan, because I only do work related to the division of retirement assets during a divorce.   1. When a portion of a spouse's pension is given to the other spouse during a divorce, a document known as a QDRO (qualified domestic relations order) will need to be prepared. For the preparation of a QDRO on your behalf, or to review a QDRO that the opposing party may have prepared, I will strongly encourage you to find a QDRO attorney to do it. Preparing these documents for the division of retirement assets in a divorce has to do more with retirement plan law than family law. A divorce attorney could be great to have on your side when you are divorcing or in any divorce situation (and you should hire one in your area), but when it comes to the enforcement of the division of a retirement asset, a QDRO attorney with experience working with retirement plans could be a better option for you than a divorce attorney who may not be as familiar with retirement plan law.  2. Each party is at risk of losing a lot of benefits ($$$) when the QDRO is not properly written. Little words make a BIG difference in the world of QDROs. Also, a lot could be lost if the QDRO is not drafted promptly within a reasonable time after the divorce.  3. You may do your divorce pro-se and also file the QDRO in court by yourself (you don't need an attorney to file the QDRO for you) BUT, for anything that has to do with WRITING or REVIEWING a QDRO, I would strongly encourage you to find an attorney, with experience in, and knowledge of, retirement plans and high sophistication with QDROs to do the actual preparation of the QDRO on your behalf (or to review a QDRO prepared by opposing party).   4. You don‰Ûªt need a local QDRO attorney because most federal law regulates the 401(k) plan to which the QDRO applies so any QDRO attorney in the country can help you. There are a few well-qualified QDRO attorneys across the country. Focus on finding a QDRO attorney, not just a family lawyer to do the actual preparation (or review) of the QDRO. Do your research before hiring.   5. QDROs are NOT neutral documents. You need your own QDRO attorney to draft or review the QDRO prepared by the opposing party‰Ûªs attorney. You need somebody who will look after your interests. I would be wary of anybody offering to prepare a QDRO for you and the other party, ""representing"" you both simultaneously.   6. Hiring a QDRO attorney in addition to your divorce attorney does not necessarily mean it will cost you more. QDRO attorneys usually charge a flat fee. The cost is worth it if you hire somebody who is a QDRO attorney with background on retirement plans. The flat fee cost is outweighed by the fact that your benefits will not be lost.   7. The Plan administrator may easily have approved a QDRO that complies with legal requirements regardless of whether the QDRO actually protects your interests. The Plan approval of a QDRO does not mean that the QDRO was properly drafted for your benefit. It only means the QDRO meets a few basic requirements mandated by law.

In Michigan each homeowner and his or her dependents may exempt up to $37,775 of his or her interest in his or her home or other property covered by the homestead exemption. If the homeowner is age 65 or older or is disabled, the exemption amount is $56,650.  If you are married, then you can double the exemption amount if you own the home as tenants by the entirety or as husband and wife.  Please click on ""Find a Lawyer"" above and retain a bankruptcy lawyer. Sounds like you need someone to look into the title, clouds on title and liens and determine what is a lien and what is not, and how best to deal with your creditors. Many bankruptcy lawyers do not charge any fees up front to consult with you so its worth your while to shop around."
1795243,"You can call 311 and file a noise complaint.  Since the loud noises seem to be occurring during Ramadan,  they probably will be over by the time the City gets around to checking on your complaint.

1565725,"In order to get into the SD-FL LMM Program, you'll need to dismiss your current CH 14 and file a new one.   However, given what you've said above, that might be the smarted move for you.   The things that make the SD-FL Program effective are the automatic stay and the fact that the mediation takes place under the supervision of the BK court, which gives you recourse when the mortgage companies fail to proceed properly and fail to follow the rules. Done right, the proposed plan would be for the tentative modification payment, not the contractual + cure amount, so presumably significantly less.  You would still have the Trustees' fee, but it would be on a smaller number.  The Trustee's fee is the rice you pay for the benefits of the LMM program, which can be considerable.   If your attorney isn't knowledgable in fighting with mortgage servicers inside Ch 13 and isn't knowledgable about the LMM Program,  consult someone who is.  We have had significant success with this program."
1803531,"The issue is whether the unemployment decision will be given collateral estoppel and/or res judicata effect.  	Res judicata and collateral estoppel are related doctrines that are designed to limit or preclude relitigation of matters that have already been determined. People v. Evans, 94 N.Y.2d 499, 502 (2000). Res judicata generally precludes relitigation of claims, while collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues Id.    These are not easy legal doctrines to master. The critical issues will be whether the defendant had an opportunity to litigate and whether the same issue is being litigated now."
1795186,"The amount owed on a judgment is not static, it often increases by accruing interest, post judgment court costs ( including the garnishment) and in some cases post judgment attorneys fees. You should get an accounting of post judgment charges. However, you will likely need to pay them. Short answer the judgment was not paid in full. The creditor can go back to court to formally augment the judgment amount for post judgment costs and fees but this may incur additional fees.  You should consider your overall financial situation, if you have significant other debt you may benefit from a consultation with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney."

Probation is not on your record, your guilty plea may be on your record, but without further details I couldn't say whether it could be restricted. 2. suspended probation means that once you pay off your ticket you no longer have to pay probation fees or check in. 3. It's a speeding ticket, I don't think most employers would even care about this issue, unless you are applying for a job that required driving, and even then, if the speed was reduced it won't show up on your DDS record, which that type of job would be looking at, not your criminal record. 4.

1824909,"Absent a contractual agreement, most employment in New York is considered to be employment at will. In an employment at will situation, a person can be terminated at any time, without reason. However, there are a number of exceptions to an employment at will termination. If someone is being terminated and that person's civil rights have been violated in any way, such as age discrimination, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, race or gender discrimination, etc. Also, if termination is any way retaliatory for whistle blowing or some other act, an employer may be liable for wrongful discharge. Further, there may be reasons why you have been terminate that your ex-employer would never state to avoid liability. Based on what you have described, it appears that you may have been terminated and retaliated against because you filed a sexual harassment report.  Since it appears that you have been discriminated against because of your filing, to fully vet the facts that led up to your termination, it would be in your best interest to consult with a labor and employment attorney. Such vetting would give you a full understanding of your legal rights. Most Attorneys will give you a free initial consultation.   Best of Luck!   William J.

1798524,"Generally, when an employee signs a severance agreement which includes an affirmation that the employee voluntarily resigns in return for the severance amount, that employee will be ineligible for unemployment benefits.  Certainly, you can alter the document. However, from an employer's point of view, the voluntary resignation is a critical element of any severance agreement and it is very likely that the employer will decline to accept an altered agreement and pay the severance amount.  Good luck."
1798385,"Since Florida is a judicial foreclosure state, Deutsche Bank's ""final judgment in foreclosure"" is a judicial determination that its assignment is valid and it is entitled to sell your property at a foreclosure sale.  As others have said, you need to list Deutsche Bank and its attorney(s) in your bankruptcy petition, and file a Notice of Bankruptcy in the Circuit Court foreclosure action.  It is always best to list every entity that might have a claim, since the failure to list a creditor might lead to its debt not being discharged in your Chapter 7 filing."
1828812,"You would not be responsible for his bills so long as you don't personally guarantee them or co-sign any debts with him.  I will note that many people who are on Medicaid have the public administrator acting as guardian.  That may or may not be something needing consideration here because I could see you getting sucked into having to spend a lot of time dealing with your uncle's bills as his guardian even though you would not be responsible for paying them.  I would be looking closely at the reasons a guardian is needed and if there is a high likelihood of being subjected to constant creditor problems, then you might well want to opt to not get into this.  All of these are issues that would be good to discuss with a local attorney before you do anything."
1821101,"The law in Pennsylvania is that the 30 days run from the last day of the term of the lease (or the date the tenant surrenders possesion of the rental property with the landlord's acceptance).   The Landlord has to pay you the money on that date, too, not just provide you a letter telling you how much of your security deposit he's going to send you.  You are correct -  your landlord should have gotten the letter and money to you right before the stroke of midnight on July 30th. Here's the statute (Title 68, Section 250.512):  ""Every landlord shall within thirty days of termination of a lease or upon surrender and acceptance of the leasehold premises, whichever first occurs, provide a tenant with a written list of any damages to the leasehold premises for which the landlord claims the tenant is liable.  Delivery of the list shall be accompanied by payment of the difference between any sum deposited in escrow, including any unpaid interest thereon, for the payment of damages to the leasehold premises and the actual amount of damages to the leasehold premises caused by the tenant."""

1794698,"You may certainly do so.  Whether it makes financial sense is another question.  First, you lose the status as a homestead which means your property taxes increase and you lose homestead protections against creditors.  Second, you may be creating a possible greater taxation risk if you resell the home. Those issues are only the tip of a far greater ice berg.   You should consult in person with counsel."
1815709,"Assuming that your unit is covered by the SF Rent Ordinance (building built before June 13, 1979), you can only be evicted for certain specified reasons.

Since the landlord is asking for terms that are materially different than your old terms, you cannot be evicted for refusing to sign the agreement.   Save EVERYTHING! Keep a copy of the new proposed agreement, so that landlord cannot later lie and say it was not different than the original agreement.

2106751,"You have gotten good advice already.    An attorney cannot settle a personal injury case without the client's consent.  It sounds like you consented.  That it was verbal and not written does not matter.  In that case, the attorney has earned their fee.  You are free to get another lawyer but that will come out of your share of the recovery, if any, not his.    If you are saying you did not consent to the settlement, then the attorney may have breached their duty to you.  But it is not clear from your post that any duty was breached.  They probably could have explained to you how LOPs work, but if you got medical treatment neither you nor your insurer paid for then you should have known that someone had to pay (or agree to pay) for it.    Another lawyer will need to review the documents to advise you on whether their was breach or any reason to undo the settlement.

1813584,"I think the best defense comes from RCW 46.61.100(3)'s use of the term ""limited access roadway."" I could not find a definition for this term in the RCW itself, but using Wikipedia to explore the general definition of a limited access roadway reveals that these types of roads are to be distinguished from controlled-access roadways (commonly referred to as freeways). Since I-5 is a freeway, I would argue that it does not fit the definition of ""limited access roadway."" This argument is further buttressed by the rest of RCW 46.61.100(3), which goes on to state that a person can drive in the left lane if turning left. Obviously, the legislature could not have intended I-5 to count, since freeways do not have left turns.   Good luck."

1807299,"There are several ways to document and prove unauthorized occupants:  (1) Are they receiving mail in the occupants name at the residence?  Verify this by checking with the mailman or the post office; (2) Is the occupant's car frequently parked at the residence for long periods? (Dated & timed photos of the car at the residence;  (3) Is the occupant seen coming and going to the unit when the tenants are not home? He has his own key. Document this with a log of dates/times of coming and going; (4) Check with utility companies for any utility bills in his name, or for a sudden increase in utility usage; (5) Obtain statements from neighbors or other tenants in the building. (6) Give notice of an annual inspection.  Go in and inspect the entire unit, checking all systems for issues with water leaks, electrical, plumbing, heating, smoke detector batteries - a complete inspection. You will need to open closets and cabinets to do this (but not drawers or doors of their personal furniture). Look for signs that the occupant lives there (e.g., gender-opposite items if the person is not the same gender as the authorized tenant, shoe/clothing sizes that would not fit the tenant, etc.)  (7) Check common areas for signs of the extra occupant, e.g., shoes left outside the door, clothing left hanging to drip dry in the laundry, etc.  If it continues despite warnings and you want to document these items, it would be hard for a judge to ignore your logs of dates and times, statements from neighbors, photos of the car, inspection reports, utility statements, and the US postal service delivery."

2345136,"The simple answer is yes, those of us who have been practicing for a long time, especially for those of us who are former prosecutors have maintained those contacts.  It doesn't mean that we (I) do anything wrong, but Criminal defense is yes a relationship business. I would be careful if they said that they could get the government to do anything improper.  If he is using his relationship as a selling point to differentiate from other lawyers, there are many of us who know who to talk to pre-filing.

1826579,"Yes, she can sue you under the CC&Rs.  Civil Code Section 5975 provides that an owner in an HOA can sue another owner and/or the HOA in a dispute arising from the CC&Rs (called 'declaration' in the statute).  I have handled several of these cases and what generally happens when a person's view is impeded and he/she has the resources to file and fund a lawsuit, is that he/she will sue the owner impeding the view (for violating the CC&Rs) and the association for failing to properly apply the CC&Rs.  The HOA‰Ûªs decision would be a complete defense to the action against in and you only if the applicable restriction and/or rule was properly applied and is reasonable in light of the interests of the entire community.  There is no protected right to a view or light in California unless it is created by private agreement or equitable servitudes (which is what the CC&Rs are considered).  These cases can become very expensive very quickly.  I recommend you meet with your neighbor and see if things can be worked out before any lawsuit is filed.  If you cannot agree, then hire an experienced HOA lawyer immediately.  You will be glad you did."

1785859,"After reviewing your question and your comments it appears that you are having communication and trust issues with your attorney. The following should provide you some guidance.   First, you need read your retainer/contingency agreement to find out what you agreed to. If you do not have a copy of it, then request one from your attorney. He is required to provide you a copy.   Second, your attorney should provide you a statement of how the settlement funds will be distributed. Usually, an attorney would want to reach an agreement with all the medical providers BEFORE accepting a settlement offer because he/she will have more leverage as opposed to negotiating liens and bills after accepting a settlement offer.  Moreover, most medical bills and liens can be negotiated depending on the settlement amount, what the settlement covers, type of medical lien, the medical service provider,  applicable statutes, and some other factors.   Third, depending on how the settlement check is made out, your attorney may or may not be required to get your endorsement before depositing the settlement check into the client trust account.  Fourth, if your attorney requires that you sign the release before he/she contacts or negotiates with the medical providers, I would suggest you seek new counsel. This is a very inappropriate tactic.   I hope this helps."

If you feel that you cannot afford an attorney then you should proceed pro se."
1807280,"While a written (and signed) agreement will generally control this situation, even if there is not a written agreement, the sitter may be liable for breach of bailment. A bailment is a special kind of contract where the owner of property (called the ""bailor"") agrees with someone else (called the ""bailee"") to have that person hold the property temporarily. When the bailor comes to reclaim the property, it must be returned in the same condition (or better). If it is not in the same condition, then the bailee is liable for the loss, unless the bailee can demonstrate that he or she could not have prevented the loss.  Pet sitting is a perfect example of a bailment. The good thing about making a bailment claim is that you do not necessarily have to prove negligence. I agree that you should wait until you have completely treated your dog, and also should consider having your insurance cover the bill. You also should contact a local attorney familiar with animal law or bailments for more detailed advice."

1815194,"The waiver is too broad and non specific to be enforceable.   Additionally, the landlord can't make you waive the applicable law in this residential lease.

You can take her back to court regardless of where she lives so long as she has notice of the court date.  She will have to hire counsel and say why she has not paid or be held in contempt of court.

1795947,"Perhaps if you were willing to pay for the bank records, the executor could order them. But what would you expect to find? Who would you sue over what theory to recover money? What if the records just show living expenses and helping out the freeloaders here and there? It was your father's right to make gifts or not. Perhaps certain monetary gifts to a future heir could be considered an advance that would change the distribution of the estate, but you would have to figure out how much of a difference that would make. If money was stolen somehow, thenn the executor could sue to recover money. For the time period after your father's death, though, it may be easier to review records to ensure the accuracy of the executor's reports."
1807635,"Police can arrest people (or issue citations) and recommend to the prosecutor that formal criminal charges be filed against a person, but the prosecutor ultimately determines whether to file any formal charges and what charges to file, if any.

1806896,"Contact an employment lawyer immediately. Based on what you write in your question, your employer is cheating its workers and violating the law in multiple respects. This case may qualify as a class action, in which case you could file a lawsuit on behalf of yourself and your co-workers for unpaid wages, nonprovision of breaks, etc. Keep in mind that generally a lawsuit can reach back up to four years preceding the filing of the lawsuit, so the sooner you act, the more violations can be captured by a lawsuit.

That being said, if the two of you were to end up in court, the case would most likely be decided under the general law of partnerships, and under that she might be entitled to some interest in the second home you mention, depending on her contributions to it, and any agreement express or implied between the two of you on how the home would be treated in the event your partnership terminated.  Whomever gets custody of your daughters would probably also be eligible for child support.  In other words, she won't be entitled to have your property divided as if the two of you had been married, but she may be entitled to credit for some of the things, like the second home, under the general law of partnerships, and she might be entitled to reimbursement or payment for contributions she made to your joint lives; while that wouldn't be a mandatory claim on your inheritance, it might require you to dip into it to pay something like that.  However, any sort of details are merely speculative in the absence of all the details of your lives together.  That should only be done with a competent local attorney you've retained for the matter.  For that I would suggest you consult with a family law/divorce lawyer in NYC since those lawyers almost certainly have experience with terminating domestic partnerships."
1806041,"Yes. Same as the US citizen child of US citizen parents. As to the visa, you are not asking about the child's rights. You are asking about yours. You have no rights for a visa. You may try to seek humanitarian parole for yourself Talk to a lawyer."
1824470,"There are state-to-state variations in unemployment laws,  but in general:  you can be penalized for refusing suitable work, or for being fired from a subsequent job,  but not for failing to be hired.   So if you are paid, you should report the remuneration as pay for attending an orientation for a prospective job that did not pan out.   The agency may ask the company why, and the company may divulge the reason, but you don't know whether any of this may happen; don't borrow trouble.   If you do get notice that the state intends to end your benefits, contact a qualified lawyer or other advocate right away to represent you at the hearing."
1804070,"You've pretty much finished the job, for better or worse, and tied any attorney's hands.  Depending on what you did, the attorney may or may not be able to give you much assistance.  Consulting with an attorney before the QME would sure have been better!    It can't hurt to get a consult but you've limited the attorney's options for helping you.  In San Diego, I always refer people to Olga Mandel in La Mesa 644.2907.  Give her a call and tell her I sent you and she'll see what she can do for you."
1814291,"You can only get the tax returns he provides. It is unlikely he is falsifying them just for you: it may be he does file s false returns with the IRS.

1267194,"Disorderly conduct is a little general and doesn't really fit exactly with the California Penal Code.  The two principal sections associated with disorderly conduct are Penal Code Section 647 (f) and 415 (1), (2) and (3).  PC 647 (f) makes it unlawfull to be in a public place in such a state of intoxication that the person is unable to care for their own safety or welfare or that of others.  Experienced defense attorneys often refer to this as ""con tempt of cop"".  A person engaging in the behavior descibed is likely to become a victim of false arrest under this section.  The officer oberves the gesture and makes other observations he uses to justify a welfare check or investigation.  Upon making contact, he oberves evidence of intoxication.  When the person becomes argumentative trying to assert their rights, the officer forms the opinion that they are too intoxicated to be safe and makes the arrest.  PC 415 prohibits disturbing the peace by loud and unreasonable noise, fighting and challenging to fight.  Case law and the constitution protect the right to gesture or say offensive things to officers.  However, in the real world there can be consequences and the need to fight false charges."

1787424,"It is possible and one sure fire way is to get yourself emancipated.  Provided you can show that you are able to financially support yourself.  Your basis to emancipate yourself (to attend college)  is an excellent reason for emancipation and many judges will grant it based on that.  I agree you should talk to your mom as it sounds like she is on the fence, but if you state to her that you will attempt to be emancipated, that may convince her to let you go.  Congratulations on graduating high school and getting into college. I think you have a bright future ahead of you."
1808991,"A writ of execution directing the sheriff to seize the debtor's personal property and sell it at auction is possible, but probably not practical for the size of your judgment.  There are significant up front costs for this procedure, including moving and storage of the property pending sale, as well as the sheriff's fees.  With a small claims judgment, the cost of the collection may exceed the judgment itself.  It is still possible to do this, but you would have to be willing to front the money in hopes of getting it repaid through a successful sale.  The limit is usually double the judgment itself."
1793288,You should consult with an experienced family law attorney immediately.  It is impossible to answer your question without reviewing the agreement.  If the agreement you signed permits her to do what she is seeking then you may be hard pressed to prevent her from exercising her vacation time as you have set forth in your question.  I do not know if the agreement gives you the ability to object or veto her request if she has followed the protocol established by the agreement.  If you were to file a motion to address this issue it would not be heard until August in all likelihood so it is probably not worth the money.  Your only remedy may be to exercise your vacation time by taking the entire month of August in the same manner she took the entire month of July.
1810094,"The wonderful thing about LLCs is the flexibility they offer.  You can definitely have membership interests of 90/10 and control over decisions, etc.  Before you make that decision, however, you need to also consider the tax implications of an LLC versus a corporation (S-corp).    I definitely think you should consult with an attorney experienced in this are of law to draft the Operating Agreement and prepare the paperwork for you so you don't have issues down the road.  Good luck."
1826499,"Contact the  immigration attorney that filed the H-3 visa on your behalf to find out if you are out of status after receiving the H-3 denial. If the F-1 status has ended then you need to determine if you have been out of status for over 180 days.  If that is the case, you will have a problem with the F-1 visa request. If you were out of status less than 180 days, you still can have problem proving to the U.S. consulate that you do not have an immigrant intent."

1796008,"The officer often includes one of the several possible reasons that your license is suspended, on your citation for driving while license suspended. A financial responsibility suspension is one of them.  Financial responsibility or FR suspension, means that your license is suspended either for canceling an insurance policy and not renewing it, having an accident or a DUI conviction or a points conviction without sufficient insurance coverage as required by law, or having a judgment relating to an accident against your drivers license.  You should immediately hire a criminal defense attorney to defend you on the driving while license suspended charge, which may carry jail time.   Your attorney can help you negotiate your way out of the financial responsibility suspension as well.   There maybe other reasons that your license is suspended and your lawyer can investigate those and may be able to help you with those as well.  Call a private criminal defense attorney for a free consultation on your drivers license issue and case today."
1789510,"If you're truly afraid to go back to India, you should definitely talk to an experienced asylum attorney and see if he or she thinks you have a good claim.  If you do, you should apply.  (There is likely a problem because a long time has elapsed since you arrived and since you lost your legal status -- which may be a bar to asylum.  However there are other asylum-like protections available.)  Even if you don't win asylum the first time around, you will get a second chance to make your case when you are in removal proceedings -- plus two levels of appeal.  You will be able to get work authorization along the way.    Staying here illegally without doing anything about your status really doesn't give you much of a future.  Ultimately, only an attorney familiar in detail with your circumstances can help you evaluate your options.  Asylum is a complex area of law, and very dependent on the particular facts of your case and the evidence you have available to you.  Good luck!"
1787476,"Yes. Just because your company doesn't have a harassment policy doesn't mean you are not protected. If he threatened you at work, complain to management immediately. If he emailed or texted the threats, show management these threats. Also, call the police and report him immediately; what he's done can be considered illegal. If you've slept with him, you can file a PFA against him if you fear for your own safety. Call the local police and ask how you can do this as well.  These are just some steps you can take to protect yourself. If the company or police blow you off, contact an attorney immediately."
1801746,"Emancipation doesn't exist under statutes in Nebraska. That means that you can ONLY get an emancipation at the Judge's discretion. You would need, at a minimum, to prove that you can 1. financially support yourself and 2. you are responsible enough to care for yourself without ANY adult supervision. At 12 years old, you are not going to be able to do this.  What I would recommend is attempting to set up a guardianship with your aunt. You can call an attorney, or have your aunt call about this.  Bottom line though, unless your parents are doing something CPS worthy you are stuck. They are your parents."
1829192,"In California judgments carry annual interest in the rate of 10%. In addition, the creditor may add to the judgment amount costs associated with the collection. The judgments are valid for a period of 10 years and may be extended for another period of 10 years. In order to determine the accurate amount owed on the judgment you need to contact the creditor and request a payoff amount. Considering that you have two judgments and your wages are garnished, you may want to talk to an attorney and see if bankruptcy or some type of a debt settlement arrangement is an option for you.  Most attorneys offer free consultation."
1803213,"In Palm Beach County recent events have caused vacancies in the Magistrate positions.  Court Administration has brought in a retired Magistrate to help with the load and they are interviewing to fill one of the positions, but they will be short handed for a while and you can expect delays because of the situation."
1969086,"I take it the line of work involved isn't diplomacy.  If he was publicly sanctioned that is a fact an not actionable.  If you said he had a record of dishonesty could be over the line if you can't prove it.  As far as it being unethical to hire someone, where's your consideration of redemption in hiring?  May he not be the sinner (sic) reformed?  So hiring him isn't unethical though perhaps from a risk management perspective makes for more work.  And that is a judgment/opinion, not a fact, but you probably haven't made friends and should watch your back.  Keep a low profile, listen a lot, do not put any details on this site as it's public, don't put anything at all about this on any site and even on emails.  Certainly never, never, never have any discussion about anything like this a) on firm em ail ; b)on your own email account during firm time, even on lunch hours, and c) from a firm computer even if it's the laptop you take home.  Just don't. Line up a lawyer to talk to--I'd suggest Guy Donatelli.   Follow the way of the sage, Lei Lo."
1800944,"If your arrears are being paid through the Office of Child Support Enforcement Agency (OCSE), you  should talk to them to see if they would be willing to modify the arrearages (subject to what is in the best interest of the child), if you are receiving state assistance.    If you are not paying the arrears through OCSE, but are paying them directly to the other parent, then you and the other parent can reach an agreement as to whether to reduce the arrears owed.  However, even if the two of you are able to reach an agreement reducing (or even vacating any arrears), you must explain to the Court why it is in the child's best interest to reduce/vacate the arrears owed.  If the Court agrees that it is in the best interest it can then enter an order incorporating your agreement with the other parent.   I  would  recommend speaking with an attorney to weight your options and to fully understand what possible outcomes can occur."
1789359,"Based on what you have described, it sounds like the PO is a bully.  But I doubt he would admit he said those things to you in court or anywhere else.  Realistically, you'll have to try to work with this guy but you should do what you can to get off probation as quickly as possible.  If you have been compliant on probation for a year and have your fees paid up, then you can try to get off probation early.  You will need to hire a criminal defense lawyer to file a motion for you in Clark County District Court.  I can't tell if you're saying your probation period was ""not to exceed 1 year"" or your underlying suspended sentence was 1 year (i.e., it was a gross misdemeanor charge).  If your sentence was probation not to exceed 1 year, then you should be off probation unless the judge extended it (which the judge can do under NRS 176A.500).  If your criminal charge was a gross misdemeanor, then the maximum time period for probation is 3 years.  Search for criminal defense attorneys in Las Vegas who are familiar with filing motions to terminate probation for more information.  Good luck."
1791921,He could file a Petition to Determine the Nonexistence of the Parent-Child Relationship. Your boyfriend should consult with an attorney.
1806770,"Yes, turning himself in looks good, and in the grand scheme of things, your boyfriend's violations are not that bad. He hasn't picked up new criminal charges and he hasn't gone missing for months on end. He probably has a good chance of reinstatement, but my assessment might change based on facts not presented in your question or knowledge about his judge, who ultimately decides what happens. Keep in mind, a good criminal defense attorney can make the difference between reinstatement or revocation. Good luck."
1380332,"Yes, she can."
2044941,"Yes, absent an order he can, although it is unlikely to succeed.  I would file an allowance for attorneys fees to defend this action.  I doubt standard interrogatories would help, you need specific ones.  A lifetime order is very valuable, hire a lawyer ASAP"
1802237,You should contact a local immigration attorney.  Without knowing the time frame in which you won it is hard to know whether not hearing from the embassy by now is concerning.  Good luck!
1826258,"Yes. The judgment creditor is not a party to your divorce and doesn't give a flying fruit loop hole what you, your spouse, the lawyers and the judge work out between the two of you. If you divorce assigns to him and he leaves you holding the bag, they can look to you for it all. You can seek to hold him in contempt, but you can not waive the decree at the judgment creditors as a shield."
1822781,"No.  Work furlough is NEVER possible with a DOC sentence.  If you have 2 prior, allegeable felonies that the State is willing to NOT allege in your plea, your attorney did a VERY good job negotiating a very favorable plea for you.  With a non-dangerous offense, a one-year sentence means that you will be out in about 10 months minus any time that you've done on THIS case, and, possibly, with a 90-day early release, you could be out in an little as 7 months.  The alternative is 10-years of prison, presumptive, if you are found guilty at Trial, and the State is able to prove your 2 priors (which is the equivalent of shooting a very big fish in a small barrell).   The absolute minimum would be 6 years in prison (mitigated sentence).  Without knowing more (your attorney is in the absolute best position to give you advice, not attorneys on the internet who know only what you've written in a paragraph on-line about your case), you might want to get your affairs in order and get this short stint in DOC over with."
1793805,"If you could get an order for a certain amount of money toward premiums, you should be able to get a wage garnishment on his paycheck for this amount, in addition to the child support.

1805675,"I agree with Attorney Fizer, your recitation suggests a complicated fact pattern. Gather your medical records and consult a TX medical malpractice attorney for further clarity."
1799882,"Most likely you have legal claims that can be enforced here, but you may be able to improve the situation by utilizing your school's administrative grievance process. If you have informally sought the intercession of the department chair without success, you may need to rely on your school's administrative appeal process.   Most schools have an admin process for student challenges/appeals of grades, course credits, and other faculty and administrative decisions that impact the student's record. Get a copy of your school's admin grievance process and make your appeal according to the specific rules and requirements of the process. Failures to comply with all specifics of the process are generally held to constitute waiver, so your compliance needs to be meticulous. Act quickly because time limits for these admin processes are always very short.   All states require such admin processes to be utilized and exhausted before there is any recourse to legal process. Once the admin process has been completed, you may have rights to judicial review of the results of the admin process, but that review is generally very limited: did the school substantially comply with its admin process? was there any evidence to support the school's findings in the admin process. If the reviewing court finds that the school failed on either of these grounds, the court can order a new course of the admin process.   Under no circumstances will a court impose a different judgment in your dissertation process.  Be clear about that: NEVER happen. And you will not be able to successfully sue for damages on these facts, either. But the admin process will allow the school to cause a correction in the situation if the school is persuaded that a correction is appropriate. There is no downside to you making recourse to your school's admin process."
1812084,"You're in a world of hurt, especially because this is your 2nd DUI WHILE on probation with an accident.  I've seen some pretty bad DUI cases.  I just got done representing a 4th offense Felony DUI with .29% BAC that ultimately I got dismissed due to a technicality, however, the technicality had to be there... because there was no way the DA was going to reduce that case with such a high blood alcohol level.  That said, for a case as serious as yours, you're going to need help via a local KY DUI lawyer regardless if it gets reduced or not."
1828675,"You do not need her signature, what you need is to serve her with a summons.  If you know where she lives that is sufficient to get her served.

1794248,"This is going to sound harsh and I don't mean it that way. Stark reality sometimes sets in.  My advice to you is that you find another place to live. If things are this bad with a lease, or rent paid, they are much worse without.  And frankly, if you want to live a functional life, being away from dysfunction is much healthier.  Your parents are adults, and so are you. None of you owe support to the others. If they want a divorce, let them get one.  If you want to find happiness in life, you have to find it within yourself and part of that is moving on from the situation you're in.   Finally, your dad gave you a five day notice to move out. With or without a court order, you are better off moving out anyway.   And as the others pointed out, its simply a tough sell to try and stay in a house with that kind of drama going on."
1796964,"You have a problem that requires court attention.  As long as he is attorney of record, all pleadings and notices are going to him, and he if he is not relaying them you may not have a clue as to what is going on.  First thing, check the Clerk's docket on-line--NOW, so that you will know what has been filed.  Second, bring a Motion to Discharge the Attorney.  Indicate that you discharged the attorney but the attorney has not moved to withdraw, and set the Motion for hearing.  As soon as possible.  Like, tomorrow would not be too soon.  Also, you may want to check out Rule 2.516 of the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration.  It allows unrepresented persons to ""opt-in"" to receive pleadings by email.  I realize you are represented, but it could not hurt for you to do so at the same time you make your Motion to Discharge.  Worst that happens is Plaintiff ignores it because they are entitled to ignore it, but maybe they just add your name to their service list.  If I were the Plaintiff I would do that so that I could show the judge later on that I sent pleadings to anyone and everyone, your attorney, you.  Better than having to redo something because you weren't provided something."
1811279,"Was there any balance owed after the sale?  If not, or if there was and you paid it, the tradeline should show a zero balance, and it could refer to the repo as long as it also shows that it was later paid (if you did pay it off).  If there was a balance after the repo that remains unpaid, they can show the balance in their tradeline.  I suggest showing the reports to a consumer law attorney to see if they believe the way it is being reported on your Trans Union report is accurate.  If it is not, you should send a dispute to Trans Union, which includes proof that the tradeline is not accurate. You should also send a copy to Capital One.  If the tradeline is not corrected after your dispute, you can pursue your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act with a consumer law attorney.  Most take good FCRA cases on a contingency basis."

1818471,"I work for insurance companies as outside counsel and worked for an insurance company for 6 years.  I would hold off singing the release until they pay for the rental reimbursement.  Most insurers will set up the rental with you over the phone and direct bill the rental company.  Should not be much harder than making a quick phone call to your adjuster to make sure the direct bill was set up.    Generally speaking most insurers will not require you to sign a release for a property damage claim.  Part of the reason for this is that when they start to tear down the vehicle they can find additional unseen damages.  As an example, your bumper has a cover that goes over a foam/cushion, but without taking the cover off the adjuster cannot know if it was damaged and will not be able to write it up.  They are usually called out to do a supplement that covers any additional unseen damage.  I can't see how they can ask you sign anything until the repairs are completed."
1798281,"Most judges will want to know what steps you both have taken to avoid the situation that brought about the protection order.  That is, has the person against whom the order was issued gone to anger management or other counseling, has there been marriage counseling.  Of course if you admit to having contact with one another, the party against whom the protection order was issued is admitting to conduct which could get him/her arrested.  It might be useful for you to speak with Mr. Brown or another attorney in Pueblo who can help you avoid getting into a mess in court.  Good luck to youl"
1796764,"As Ms. Erlich stated, you would have a defense to a 2nd case filed after the Statute of Limitations would bar such a refiling.  One thing you should be made aware of.  Ordinarily, the running of a Statute of Limitations is an Affirmative Defense, which means you have to assert it when you file an Answer to the Complaint.  However, there is case law in Florida that says that if the SOL can be determined from the face of the Complaint, then a Motion to Dismiss is proper.    Example:  law suit is based on breach of a contract and there are no specific dates as to when the money is due--well, then all of the facts have to be fleshed out during the course of the litigation.  But if there is a bill attached that says payment is due on MM/DD/YEAR and the case is filed after the SOL has run from that date, then you can move to dismiss the case, not wait til you Answer to try to get the case tossed."
1800654,"It is possible to do this before your divorce is finalized.  However, I would not quit claim the house to him without an agreement in place.  There are many potential issues that will need to be addressed in the agreement and you definitely want to make sure you are protected.  In addition to protecting your interest in the equity in the house you will need contingencies in the agreement in the even he is not able to refinance.  All of this should be worked out before the agreement is finalized and you sign the deed.  It is also possible to enter into an agreement on just the house before you have a comprehensive separation/divorce agreement completed.  But, yes, you do want an agreement in place and enacted before you sign the deed.  I also would not finalize an agreement entered into at mediation without having private counsel review it for you.  This is a routine practice and family counsel generally will act as review counsel for parties who have gone through a mediation.  A reviewing counsel will review the agreement with you and look for potential issues in the agreement and make sure you understand the nature of what you are agreeing to.  The clear benefit of a reviewing counsel is that this is an attorney that is looking out for your best interests versus someone who is acting as a neutral at the mediation."
1807912,"You should file a complaint against this dentist with the dental practice Board in your State.  Complain about his lack of skill and rough treatment.  Well-placed filling should not come out in 2 weeks.  Many fillings need to be polished and checked for appropriate bite.  His failure to do this is probably a deviation from the accepted standard of practice.  However, this is not a situation for a medical malpractice claim, as it would be too expensive to pursue for the little damages you have.  If you have another dentist repair the fillings, you will need to pay that dentist.  You can always ask your first dentist to reimburse you for this cost, however, this does not warrant the expense and time of a malpractice lawsuit.

This is so even in the very employee friendly state of CA.   You can only file an EEOC claim if you have reason to believe  your dismissal was based on protected class matters, such as race or religion. Doing so out of spite is not only selfish it can backfire pretty easily.   Unless you have a contract that stipulated just cause, there is likely nothing you can do outside of filing for benefits, but you only your own lawyer can advise after all the details are disclosed.   I suggest that you consult with a lawyer in private and discuss your objectives and options  in more detail. You can start by calling around to several for a free phone consultation, get some insights then pick the best fit to work with.   Best regards,  Frank Natoli-Lapin, LLC"
1801014,"Your landlord emptied out your bank account? How? Did you give him access to your account? On these facts it sounds like you might have claims against your landlord and your bank and should also report this to the police.  On the other hand -- just a guess -- maybe what you are saying is that your landlord filed suit against you, obtained a judgment, and had the sheriff levy your bank account? If this is what happened, you should have received official notice of this from the bank, ahead of time, giving you an opportunity to challenge this. If the bank failed to provide the required notice you may have a claim against the bank."
1796926,"Having a child go back and forth for a year at a time would be very confusing and detrimental to your child's well being.  When the court makes a decision about custody, it looks at what is best for the child,not what is best for the parents. Your son's father chose to move to Texas and away from your son.  If he wants more time with his son, he could move back to Erie, or visit more often.  Summers and possibly some  holidays would be an option to give him more time.  As Attorney Myers stated, make you you have a Pennsylvania court order in place, before your child leaves the state for a visit with dad."

1818395,"Yes, you would need to subpoena them (for all the good it will do). These subpoena's are often ignored. It's all you can do. Also, you would have to subpoena a person (a witness). There is no document (record) that is normally kept by a property management company that says who doesn't live there. You can only subpoena documents that are (or you believe) to be kept by the business. You cannot subpoena someone to ""create"" a document (e.g. a letter that you never resided at the residence). You need to subpoena a witness to testify to that fact.    Normally, a debtor would provide proof of where they were residing at the time. That is usually the easier path.  Good luck."

880310,"First, talk with your son about whether or not he has given the lawyer permission to talk to you about his case.  If not, the lawyer cannot tell you anything that is not in the public record.  It does not matter who paid the lawyer; your son still has the right to confidential advice.  Second, read over the written contract that you or your son signed when the attorney was hired.  It should provide some information, such as what services were included in the ""everything"" you say it covered.  If it does not include work on an appeal or other post-conviction legal work, then from the attorney's point of view you are just complaining about the result in a case that is over.  Personally, if I were the attorney, I would make or accept one phone call from you just to explain things, which probably includes explaining that the case is over."
1819691,"You should stay away from any potential inference that you are a ""Law Firm"" or anything that may suggest you are or have a relationship with an attorney.  As the other response indicates, a non-attorney cannot own a law firm or have a stake in one as a general rule.  However, you could offer ""Doe Paralegal Services"" or ""Doe Document Prep"", etc.  Two rules you should abide by and you will likely be safe:  1)  Do not, in any way, shape or form, make any suggestions that you are a law firm/attorney if you are not actively licensed.  2)  As a non-attorney, you cannot, by law, offer legal advise.  That is considered the unauthorized practice of law.  If you a document preparation company, this means that you cannot advise indivduals of which documents to prepare.  You simply must ask them what they need prepared and do that only.  You cannot make recommendations based on their situation - that is practicing law."

1794101,"If she were prosecuted for insurance fraud, the State would have to persuade the Jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, at the time she made application for and accepted death benefits pursuant to the life insurance policy contract, she knew the husband was not dead.   The Judge would instruct the Jury before it deliberated that, any member not so persuaded, should vote Not Guilty.   In order to reach a binding verdict, all members of the Jury must all vote the same, i.e, all Guilty or all Not Guilty.    Regardless whether the beneficiary  were criminally prosecuted or convicted, upon learning that the husband faked his death, the life insurance company might commence a civil case against the beneficiary seeking rescission of the insurance contract and return of the benefits paid on a theory of ""mutual mistake"" and/or ""unjust enrichment."""

1806831,"With your prior felony record and the nature of the charges here, you're probably not going to avoid another felony here. It's difficult to evaluate your chances at trial, since I can't see any of the evidence. If the prosecution's case relies upon the testimony of the alleged victim, and the alleged victim is uncooperative, recanting, or nowhere to be found, then your chances are relatively good. If you have some credible defense, like self defense, to present at trial, your chances are decent. Of course, any defense that has to be presented through your testimony is going to be hindered by the fact that you can be ""impeached"" with your prior felony if you take the stand. But if the state doesn't have witness of other proof problems, and you don't have a strong affirmative defense to present, then you'll probably be convicted at trial. If I were your attorney, I would be trying to get you probation with drug and/or mental health treatment. I would not be anxious to roll the dice and go to trial under the facts you've presented here."
1791751,"Good advice from Mr. Rasberry; let me expand on it briefly.  There may be a more powerful remedy available to you, which you should discuss with your attorney. If the texts from your ex are threatening to the extent that they place you in fear of physical harm (and the texts would cause a reasonable person in your situation to believe that they were in danger of physical harm), you may be able to obtain an Order of Protection.  Same applies if the texts from your ex can reasonably be read to subject you to, threaten you with, or place you in fear of, the offense of stalking.  Definitely seek the advice of experienced counsel on this; you do not want to seek an Order of Protection without solid, provable grounds, and even if your case warrants the issuance of an Order of Protection, there are other important considerations to factor into the mix, before deciding that the Order of Protection is/is not the best way to proceed.  Good luck to you and your children during this harrowing time."

1798309,"California does not have a true ""expungement"" statute. What we do have is a dismissal under Penal Code 1203.4. If granted, it doesn't wipe the case off your record, but it adds a notation that the case was dismissed. That allows you to tell most employers that you have not been convicted of the crime, but it remains on your record and still counts as a prior conviction.   If you want that relief, you have to apply for it - it's not automatic. It's also not an overnight process. It can take weeks or months, depending in the county.   Keep in mind that the 1203.4 dismissal does NOTHING to your DMV records. It will remain there.   You're just under the 7 years, unfortunately and according to the terms of your application, you'll have to disclose this. If you don't and they find it later, they can (and probably would) fire you for lying on your application.

1826512,"First of all, I think you should ask your professors this question, and I am surprised there is no class on the subject of ethics in your curriculum.  However, once you answer a question in regard to a specific legal issue, and give specific advice, that would be UPL.  Imagine that you give such advice, and then the issue blows up, and the person finds out that your advice was incomplete, or insufficient, or just plain wrong for their full circumstances.  They would likely complain about you, and then you would be investigated by the Bar.  Is it worth that to not tell someone that what they really need is a lawyer? There is a case where a lawyer once went to a party hosted by a friend to celebrate her opening a fashion warehouse.  The lawyer and the friend chatted, and the friend said she was thinking about getting additional insurance.  The lawyer, as a friend, noted the extensive sprinkler system and wondered if that was needed.  Then there was a fire.  The friend sued the lawyer for malpractice and the Bar found that the lawyer had given legal advice by not making it clear that he wasn't giving legal advice.  So, while this is not your situation precisely, you can see that the boundaries are quite easily traversed, and there is danger for both you and the person you advise when there is confusion or a difference of opinion later.  Ask one of your instructors, or call the Florida Bar for specific advice, but always err on the side of caution.  This answer is for educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice nor make you a client of this firm.  See how it works?"
1825656,"Mr. Dugan is right.  But the system is a bit silly.  So they do the SSI first and pay you from date of application to the present, presuming no other substantial income.  So you get ALL those months of SSI.  Then the work on the SSDIB:  the 4 or 5 months from your accident (onset date) you can't get SSDIB, but you got SSI.  That is yours to keep, no effect/offset.  But by month 5 or 6, you were (with hindsight now!) eligible for SSDIB. But, you got SSI for that month, as if you didn't have other income - but now they are PAYING you for that month with SSDIB, so you DID (hindsight) have income.  So it turns out you were NOT eligible for that welfare check due to SSDIB that month.  So from the SSDIB amount that is owed you, they will take out for the SSI they clumsily paid you for that month.  It is not so much a ""loan ""as it is a reversal and correction of which fund should have been paying you - not SSI, you weren't poor enough (in hindsight).  Why they don't just spend an extra 20 minutes working out the corrections before paying out is beyond me - but claimants are routinely surprised and upset when they erroneously think they will be getting both benefits each month - when that is entirely not true."
1786495,"My condolences on the loss of your friend. In order for his Will to be legally effective, it has to be offered for probate and admitted. If your friend was a Georgia resident, that means that his heirs must generally receive notice that the Will has been offered for probate (unless the executor files in common form, which is not preferred because it does not bind the heirs for four years), and given a chance to object to having the Will probated. That in itself takes a while sometimes. The next step, once the Will has been admitted to probate and an Executor appointed, is for the Executor to determine what assets and debts exist. Even if there are no known debts, the Executor must file a Notice to Debtors and Creditors. That runs for 1 month in the official legal newspaper for the appropriate county, then there is a three month period in which unknown possible creditors are supposed to make themselves known. The Executor is given 6 full months after being appointed (that means the Probate Court has admitted the Will to probate and issued letters testamentary, not that the death occurred) before he has to pay most debts or make any distributions. The Executor's job is to protect the estate during that period: this means that locking the house and changing the locks, preserving the personal property, and keeping the car in a safe place is all very likely to be the correct actions to take at this point. Once the Executor has had a chance to determine what assets there are, make sure any debts are paid, make sure any needed tax returns have been filed, and do all the other tasks needed to property administer an estate, then, if the house is still in the estate and did not have to be sold to pay debts or higher-priority items, it should eventually be distributed to your brother. If he thinks that things are not being done correctly or are taking too long, he is also free to hire his own attorney to represent him. The Executor's attorney cannot provide your brother with any legal advice.   Nothing you've said seems weird from my perspective, although I can see why it might if you're not used to dealing with estates. Until the Will has been fully admitted to probate, your brother's interest isn't even enforceable, so that is likely one reason he's not being given a lot of information yet. It sounds like it's still very early in the process. Even once the Will has been admitted, there are a lot of tasks in any estate, even a simple one, which need to be addressed before distribution of assets can begin. But I don't hear anything in your post which sounds suspicious."
1802701,"Hello,  First of all, U.S. citizen children must be at least 21 years of age to sponsor a parent.  Even then, there are potential complications where a parent is inadmissible, since children are not qualifying relatives for most inadmissibility waivers.  Also, there is no guarantee that any executive action, or even C.I.R. if it passes, would just ""erase"" a prior removal order.     If someone ignores a removal order, then files an application for adjustment of status with the Immigration Service, rather than approving the application, the Immigration Service very likely will detain that person and try to remove him/her from the United States.  Indeed, even without filing anything, someone with a removal order is subject to having it enforced at any time.  In certain, rare cases, it is possible to reopen old removal orders or request waivers. of the prior removal/deportation.  However, these cases are very fact-specific and challenging, and not everyone is able to qualify.  Thus, I would encourage your friend to consult with a licensed, experienced immigration attorney about whether he may be able to do either of those things, or possibly have some other remedy, or whether he should try to keep waiting.  Best wishes, Jennifer"
1795326,"Unless his mistress is married to someone else, the child will not be legitimate when born.  He will need to file a Petition to Legitimate this child or marry his mistress after you divorce.  The only ramifications it will have on you are that the child born of his mistress will probably be a ""qualified child"" when calculating support awarded to you (although it wasn't exactly clear in your fact pattern whether or not you had children).  Certainly it should have an affect on your divorce because adultery is grounds for divorce and when establishing divisions of property and alimony, the court looks to conduct of the parties as a factor.  It sounds like his conduct wasn't very good.  There are, however, many other factors to be considered.  Also, he can still sign the birth certificate when the baby is born if you are still married."
1792050,"In addition to the concerns that are expressed in the prior answers, you must also keep in mind that even if you are approved on a new claim, your benefits do not start immediately. On any new claim, the earliest that you can be found disabled is one day after the ALJ decision. So if you were denied July 9, 2014, the earliest you can be approved on a new claim is July 10, 2014. Even though you can be approved as of July 10, 2014, SSDI has a mandatory five month waiting period before any payments can be made after the date an individual is found disabled. If you are found disabled on any day other than the first of a month, your payments cannot begin until the next full month.  This means that if you are found disabled on July 10, 2014, your five month waiting period takes you December 10, 2014, since that is not the first of the month, your first possible month of eligibility would not be until January 2015. So in actuality you give up a lot of potential past-due benefits by not appealing.  My other concern in filing a new application so close to the date of an ALJ denial, is that you cannot be found disabled until the day after the decision, sometimes Social Security takes that to mean that they will only look at medical evidence since the new onset date. If you immediately file a new application, that means that their may only be a couple of months of medical evidence to review at the time a decision is being made. If nothing really changed since the ALJ denied, normally, even on a new claim, they will look at the ALJ decision and still determine you are not disabled.  There may be very good reasons that your attorney is recommending that you not appeal your ALJ decision (such as not having enough evidence to prove you were disabled in the first place), but I always look at what will be different on a new claim. If I am not willing to appeal an ALJ decision, I normally suggest that my clients receive additional treatment, or obtain more supportive medical opinions before I will proceed with any new claim. I typically also suggest that they wait until there is at least 6 more months of medical treatment, and that during that time there are multiple visits with specialist to establish why your condition is worse than the ALJ determined.  I would suggest that you talk to your attorney again and determine why he/she is recommending you file a new claim instead of appealing, and also determine if there is anything that you can do before applying to make your claim stronger."

Beyond the illegality of their trying to do either, just on a practical basis, no law enforcement organization notifies the person they are going to arrest ahead of time!

This is where experience really counts, but I do understand the ""price tag"" on legal services is often prohibitive to those who need it the most. In my experience as an entertainment & licensing attorney, I often meet aspiring talent / clients who have unfortunately entered into recording or licensing deals that end up suffocating emerging opportunities because they couldn't afford an experienced attorney. If I'm impressed at their showcase or with the licensing concept, I'll enter into a blended-fee arrangement that meet attorney ethics requirements/standards. There are many ins & outs regarding the licensing agreements, but licensing deals tend to be more straight forward since they are very susceptible to common licensing drafting trends. It's important to make sure you work with an attorney who understands the recording industry as well as complex licensing agreements. Not always an easy mix to find since they are quite different legal practices. Try structuring a blended-fee arrangement with the attorney you select to work with & seriously consider having the attorney fee arrangement reviewed by another attorney prior to signing. Yep, you should have an attorney review any blended-fee arrangement you make with an attorney. That's the ethical way to proceed with those relationships. Wishing you and your daughters the best!"

1796265,"Short answer to the deed - no.  Short answer to the DPOA - no.  That being said, the deed is a very important legal document that needs to be drafted properly so that when it is filed with the local recorder of deeds they will: 1. Find it acceptable in format; and 2. The recorder of deeds will accept it for filing.   A deed has several very important components and words that are needed to properly convey ownership of the property from one party to the next party. If the proper wording is left out or used incorrectly, the conveyance (transfer of ownership) to the next partly could be defective (either immediately or in the future).   This defective transfer could trigger an avalanche of legal claims and the liability for such claims will likely be directed to the drafter of the document.   So, using an attorney to draft a deed is not that costly when you think about it.   The added cost of filing the deed and handling the paperwork could be saved by you doing that part yourself, but you should leave the deed drafting to someone skilled that area.   As for the DPOA, it is much the same thing. You could go to a big box store and get a form or could get a computer program and download and complete the form, but then you are on your own.   If someone goes wrong with a transaction for the agent/principal and their is a challenge in court, the self drafted DPOA will not be viewed positively (it might be ""legal"" but not looked upon with favor) and could end up costing you more. Believe it or not, a DPOA is not that expensive and an attorney who knows how to draft them can make sure you are getting what you need and may be able to give you advice on do's and don'ts so you can keep yourself out of trouble (now and in the future).   I hope everything works out for you."
1795651,"My guess is that the PO is taking the position that your security cameras can be used to alert you if you're at home doing something you shouldn't be doing and the PO drops by, thereby allowing you to possibly avoid detection of whatever hypothetical illegal activity you're engaged in.  The PO probably isn't going to back down on the issue, so to avoid any chance of getting violated and revoked, you can do one of two things: (1) take down the cameras; (2) file a motion to modify the terms and conditions of your probation.  Why?  Because the judge has the ability to set and change the terms and conditions of probation at any time pursuant to NRS 176A.400.  There is no specific term or condition that directly addresses the issue, so the issue is ambiguous.  An additional term would resolve the ambiguity and make it clear whether or not you can have the cameras.  What you want is for the judge to add the condition that you may use security cameras.  Security cameras are for home security.  So are locks.  Would the PO take the position that you having locks on your doors prevents you from being supervised because you can lock yourself in your house to avoid detection of illegal activity?  Of course not.  So what's wrong with cameras?  It's just another home security measure.  Good luck!"

1796977,"Yes, you can likely use the emails as evidence if they are from your husband. You will need to ask the proper questions to admit it into evidence.

If the employer is claiming to have had his fee payment check cashed, then ask him to look into his online banking statements to download and print a legible copy of that ""cashed"" check.  The back of the check will have a USCIS case receipt number which begins with 3 letters, such as ""LIN"" or ""WSC"" which is the case number assigned to the petition by the USCIS Service Center where the case has been filed/received at.  With that number on hand, one can quickly follow the trajectory of that case online at www.uscis.gov and make the necessary inquires with USCIS."

1821778,In my experience the attorneys do not speak to the mediator at the courthouse who is appointed to a particular case.  There are a number of mediators depending on the county and the parties are not sent to mediation until after the Case Management Conference is held and the order indicates the parties are to attend custody and parenting time mediation.  Why is it that you are asking this question?
1828729,"First, I would first seek medical attention for yourself and children to address any injuries from the accident.  Second, I would seek a local criminal traffic attorney to address your potential (1) administrative driver's license suspension and  (2) pending traffic citations.   A conviction or a plea of guilt to these traffic citations can have be potentially used at a later time as evidence if you are sued in civil court for damages by the other party of the accident. An experienced attorney could assist in exploring other alternatives.  Do not drive until your suspension is reinstated.  Driving on a suspended license is a Georgia misdemeanor requiring:  2 days in jail, $500 to $1000 fine, 6- month driver's license suspension, and possible probation. Generally, notice is a requirement for a person to be charged with the misdemeanor of Driving on a Suspended License. You did not state why your license was suspended.     Generally, a conviction can be supported by: (1) sufficient  written notice given to, signed by, and explained to the party by the police; (2) formal notice by mail to correct address through the Department of Driver Services; or (3) by operation of law (DUI).  Good luck."
1800898,"Agg assault while DUI is a felony of the second degree with a maximum possible sentence of 10 years.  The specific circumstances of your case and any prior record will determine actual sentence, and needs to be reviewed with an/your attorney as soon as possible.    If the only substance in your blood was a metabolite, you are guilty of DUI, but agg assault while DUI requires proof that the DUI was ""the cause of the injury.""  Some marijuana metabolites are incapable of causing impairment, so you might have an argument that the DUI was not the cause of the injury.  This would likely require both an experienced DUI and traffic law attorney in your area and a medical expert to prove."
1811837,"There are some things that you have to consider if this is an ongoing issue. Now $150.00 may not be enough to sue, as it seems to you the amount is small. Sometimes though it is not about the amount it is about the ongoing refusal to pay or the inability to follow the agreement. In Maryland, we have a Child Support Enforcement Agency that can help custodial parents enforce a Court Order if there is one. I would talk to an attorney in Florida about the possibility of putting everything into a Court Order to be more easily enforced or go through the Child Support Agency in your county to try to enforce the unpaid medical bills. I would agree that sending him the bills via certified mail with a request for him to pay his portion is a good idea. But if this is an ongoing problem it might be time to stand up and do something about it."
1788059,"As angry and frustrated as you must be, there's light at the end of the tunnel.  First of all, you are probably old enough to consent to your own adoption without your biological parents' involvement.  This can be important for several reasons, not the least of which is that you would be eligible to collect from Social Security if one of them dies while you are under a certain age and still their dependent.  Check it out.  My youngest son is 24 and when he was on the verge of going to college, I was amazed and dismayed by all of the forms we had to fill out.  I'm certain your father had no idea that this non-finalized adoption would be a hurdle.  A major part of my practice is terminations of parental rights and adoptions, and I hereby bet you $10 that your father did not want to rock the boat and risk your bio-mother coming to his house and trying to get you back.  So when she and your bio-dad refused to sign the papers, your father probably just kept quiet and prayed to God they would never again darken your door.  That said, see if you can talk to the giuidance counselor at the high school you attended and see what he/she thinks -- is it better to apply listing your bio parents as your parents?  Because an adoption can be done quickly.  You will get to college.  If your writing is any indication at all of your intelligence and education, you will be able to accomplish whatever you want to.  Take a look at 90% of the attorney answers on this website, because you're writing at a higher level than most attorneys!  This is very solveable.  Go for it.  All the best,  Pat Hendrickson"

That would fly in the face of the ""Affidavit"" your sponsor signed for you where he/she assures the US government that you will NOT become a public charge, including, but not limited to asking the US government to provide you free medical care through Medicaid at US taxpayer's expense.  2) No. The affidavit is not any proof of income, but rather a guarantee to the US government that if let into the US you will not become a ""public charge"" since the ""guarantor"" who is signing the affidavit assures the gov. that you will not, by executing such an affidavit on your behalf.  3) Again read my answer 2 above.

1794805,What you're saying does not make sense.  I've never heard of a carrier deducting anything from the bluebook value because they don't want to take the vehicle.  They are not under an obligation to do so but nor can you be penalized for that decision.  Get everything in writing from them including a print out of their offer and go speak with an attorney familiar with property damage claims.
1807555,"You don't have the luxury of NOT FILING for bankruptcy, either on your own or through an attorney.

1790604,"I recommend that you continue pursuing the worker's comp. case that you have currently pending and make it very clear to your HR person that this is a work injury.  You can take sick time and then seek reimbursement of that sick time after you have prevailed on your worker's comp. claim.  Because worker's comp. in MA only pays a maximum of 60% of your Average Weekly Wage for temporary total disabilities, you may only be able to get 60% of your sick time reimbursed.  Every company handles this issue differently. If you don't have an attorney, you really should get one.  Judges do not like hearing worker's comp. cases without an attorney and many will delay your litigation and instruct you to find representation."
1796792,"You need to consult with your attorney about this issue.  If you do not have an attorney, you need one.  The workers' compensation carrier has to pay for all causally related conditions.  If they refuse to pay, your attorney can request a hearing."
1828733,"If an employee complains about a co-worker or supervisor discriminating against that employee based on gender, national origin, race, disability, age, religion, sexual harassment, etc..., then the company is required to prevent/correct the situation (not necessarily fire the ""harasser"" or separate you from him). You used the term ""harasser"", but your description is vague. If you simply mean ""bullying,"" then the company may not be required to do anything to improve your work situation. If, however, you mean that based on a protected category, the supervisor is ""harassing"" you (i.e. making comments about your age), then if the supervisor begins to retaliate against you, the company may be liable for the supervisor's actions. If you merely complained about the supervisor ""bullying"" you, then the supervisor's potential response (treating you worse) won't technically be (from a legal perspective) retaliation either, since again, bullying isn't a protected category.   You should speak with a lawyer and provide him/her with more specific details as to what specifically you complained about to your employer. Only then can a lawyer determine if you have a valid case, or what to demand in terms of ""better treatment."""
1812396,"Attorneys tend to focus on only certain aspects of the law which allows them to specialize.  Most are unwilling to deviate from the area they know, so they will in turn refer you to other professionals and in most instances this makes sense.  You need an attorney that is an experienced entrepreneur that  understands all aspects of a startup and managing a small business.   Someone who has ""walked in your shoes"" will be able to advise you not simply what laws you need to comply with now but how to proceed with growth and success in mind.  Not all business attorneys are willing or have the experience to advise in this capacity.     Find the right attorney and your problems will be solved.  I am an attorney licensed in California. My practice includes Entrepreneurial and Healthcare law.  I have not spoken to you, I have not reviewed the relevant documents and facts, and I do not represent you.

1801133,"Somewhat of a weak basis for an Order of Protection, but certainly a better case for an injunction.   Any OP gets consolidated with the divorce case, so you go to a domestic relations judge vs. 555 W Harrison.  Most judges, if they won't grant an OP, will be tempted to instead grant an injunction at the return date for the plenary.    Usually an angry letter from a lawyer stops 70% of these, but the remaining 30% usually requires judicial intervention.  Or you can just bear it and move on.    Sadly, the police won't do anything unless you have an order signed by a judge."
1829547,"When you say that your child's father has ""full custody,"" I assume that you mean that there's a court-ordered judgment granting him legal custody of the child. It is surprising to me that a court would have awarded primary legal custody to someone in the country without immigration status, but it is possible. If you do have such a judgment on file with the Court, it probably contains a provision that prohibits either parent from moving the child more than 60 miles further distant from the other, without the other parent's written approval or the order of the Court. Such a move would be a basis for modifying the child's custody. In order to get a Court's permission to move a child away, the moving parent must prove that the move is in the child's - not merely the parent's - best interests. Because courts presume it is in the best interests of a child to have regular and ongoing contact with both parents, and because courts disapprove of parents interfering in the ongoing relationship between a child and their other parent, this is a hard standard to meet. So either parent is free to leave at any time - they just aren't supposed to bring the child with them.  That said, all this only describes what courts expect people to do, or order them to do - not what they actually do. The fact of the matter is, there's nothing you can do to physically stop your co-parent from moving away with your child. If he does, you can file an immediate motion with the Court to modify custody, and seek a 'temporary protective order of restraint' that requires that the child stay where they are. You'd have to serve it on him for it to be effective, and then you'd have to enforce it. If he totally disappears, or goes to a country that won't honor American States' custody orders, this will not really be possible. The only way to try to prevent this from happening is to seek an award of primary physical custody yourself before it happens. Without knowing the details of your case history, we can't say how likely that is to succeed. You may want to discuss this with a family law attorney in private."
2119905,"You need to press them on this.  The favorite tactics of insurance adjusters is delay, deny, and blame others.  Your insurance company has a 'duty of good faith and fair dealing' towards you under the Texas Insurance Code.

1816887,"If she has chosen not to visit or be involved, the court cannot force her to become a responsible parent and cannot make her visit if she doesn't want to.  If she suddenly is showing an interest in visiting etc., and exercising her rights under the plan, but you are concerned about the effect because of her past behavior,  you can file for contempt and seek an order for counseling as a prerequisite/in conjunction with resuming contact.   Child support is separate from visitation, but it doesn't sound as if there is much there for you to collect from."

1800227,"There is no simple answer to the question you ask:  why would the defendants agree to mediation?  It may be that they appreciate the value of your claim, and want to settle quickly, and privately.  Or, it may be that they see mediation as a good way to get free discovery about the weaknesses of your claim, to help them oppose it.    Don't assume that the affidavit changed their minds.  It may simply be strategic on their part.  It sounds like you don't have a lawyer.  I changed the practice area of your question to Employment/Labor in the hope that an Avvo lawyer in your area who specializes in employment discrimination cases can give you some more specific feedback.  You might consider getting backup, even an initial consultation with someone who could help you prepare for the mediation, or who could make some calls on your behalf to see if the company is acting in good faith."

1822960,"This is a serious matter, one that obviously involves serious injuries. The 17 year old defendant really does need to hire an attorney who is familiar with the adult and juvenile courts in the county where the charge is being prosecuted. That attorney can best advise about what to expect in court, whether the case is being prosecuted in juvenile or adult court (which will make a big difference), whether there is a possible civil suit for damages (against the juvenile and/or his family), and can assist in defending the case. Even if the injured party in this case ""takes responsibility"" there could be certainly be significant punishments in such a serious case, and the injured party clearly amassed massive medical bills, which could be grounds for a lawsuit, as well. General information in a public forum is no substitute for counsel advising about a specific case, and for a case involving massive head trauma, a family or juvenile needs personal advice from a lawyer if at all possible. If unable to hire a lawyer, the defendant should request appointment of a public defender in court, and make no further admissions about the case."

You can request temporary alimony which is alimony that is paid to you during the pendency of the case.  In some judicial circuits a party will need to attend mediation and reach an impasse (that means no agreement is reached) in order to receive a hearing date for temporary relief.  In other judicial circuits there is no requirement to attend mediation prior to receiving a date for temporary relief.  You will want to file your financial affidavit and comply with mandatory disclosure (the production of certain financial documents) in order to prove to the Court that one spouse has the need to receive temporary alimony and that the other spouse has the ability to pay temporary alimony.
2223828,"I think the asker is saying his or her parents attorney filed a Proposal For Settlement which was subsequently determined to be defective and therefore her parents were not awarded attorney fees against the Defendant who rejected the PFS.

You mention that there is no lease agreement now, but was there ever one before? Your answers would dictate what you need to evict her. In the simplest scenario, if she just kicked a door in and moved herself in, then you could treat her as a trespasser and call the police.

1824721,The burden of proof in a property damage case is a preponderance of the evidence.
1788379,"Generally, felony cases that involve forensic evidence or testing will take several (3-5) months to complete pretrial conferences, motion hearings, and bargaining. A felony trial with multiple witnesses presented by the state (including co-defendants, forensic scientists, and witnesses) will take several days, and longer if the Defendant chooses to present evidence on his own behalf. An estimate would be 6-10 days for such a trial. After the presentation of the case, the jury or bench will deliberate, and there really is no estimate for how long a jury will take - hours to days. If convicted, sentencing could be immediate, or it make take place up to a month after conviction. Even then, the Defendant may appeal his conviction, and the appellate process usually takes about a year (12 months or more.) Thus, a very general estimate would be 2-4 years until the process is completely ""over"" in the legal arena. I hope that helps give you a general idea. Good Luck."
1829913,"Dear New York Tenant:  The counterclaim does not go to the heart of the landlord's claim that you owe rent and does not set up a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.

I do not see how this is any different legally speaking.  You, of course, still may have the burden of proving that you actually deposited the funds timely, so save your deposit receipts.  If she pushes actually trying to collect these ""late"" fees, you may want to have a local attorney examine the situation carefully.

A bypass trust usually is part of a revocable or living trust.    HOWEVER, an asset protection trust is a different creature altogether. In Nevada a typical asset protection trust is IRREVOCABLE, so the grantor can't change the trust--not directly anyway.  The  basic idea is the grantor can ""control"" assets but no longer ""owns"" the assets.  The trust is designed to protect the grantor's assets from his or her creditors.  Nevada has probably the BEST asset protection laws in the US.  The trustee administering the trust money is often a professional trust company.    An asset protection trusts is ADVANCED estate planning tool.  So if you are serious, study up on the topic, ask questions, do a consult or two w a sophisticated trust/estate planning lawyer and understand what you're dealing with. Most trust lawyers do a free initial consult.  After that, plan to spend legal fees and trustee fees--but having said that, the advantages of a good asset protection trust can far outweigh those initial costs.  Good Luck, Greg J. Reno"
1824814,"Normally, if you do not decline to renew more than 45 to 90 days before the end of the lease it is an automatic renewal, depending upon how the lease is written.  This can normally be amended upon agreement of the parties.  If the landlord is saying to write a letter, then write a letter, and reference the landlord's statement to write a letter IN the letter, so that anyone reading it later can tell that you were following what you agreed to do with the landlord.  Keep copies signed by both of you so that if the matter comes up again, you have the ability to enforce the amendment.  If there are future problems, retain a landlord-tenant attorney."
1828603,"Technically you should be out by the day your lease ends. Do you need extra time? If so, I'd recommend trying to negotiate with the landlord to pay for an extra day at a pro-rated rate. If you can't negotiate that, then do your best to be out. That being said, if you're not out, your landlord may have a claim for an extra months rent owed by you / may keep a security deposit (or a portion thereof). He/she CANNOT exercise 'self-help.' That means, he/she cannot come barging in at 12:00 on the night of and try to physically kick you out. He/she cannot change the locks, etc. If you're not out, he/she can claim you owe more money and will have to go through the legal eviction process.  Best of luck."

And if so, before you can be convicted, the state would gave to prove beyond a reasonable doubt you committed a crime.  Can the store sue you in civil court for breaking the contract? Yes, and if you face any legal action this is the most likely action in my opinion."

1818962,"Your question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.  When you are accused of DUI in Colorado, there are 2 separate actions, a DMV action and the Court action.  Both of these are separate, meaning the DMV may have revoked your licenses outside of the court case.  For example, if your BAC was above a .08, the DMV may have administratively revoked your license outside of any court action.  If this is your situation, a plea to DWAI will not disturb or change the fact that the DMV revoked the license. If the plea to DWAI, which is 8 points put your license into a point suspension depends on any previous accident or tickets that generated points within the last 12 to 18 months. I would recommend contacting the DMV directly to determine if your license is revoked, the reason for the revocation, and what you need to do to get it back.  Good Luck! Laurie"

1817701,"As a psychologist, you have experience and a good understanding of the impacts that certain neurological conditions may have on polygraph test results.   First, I'm sure your defense attorney has shared with you that you are not required to submit to one under the protections afforded by your 5th Amendment rights of self-incrimination;. Next, in Arizona courts , polygraph test results may be admissible under stipulation that both the prosecution  and defense agree upon it, as well as the examiner being accredited, as well as other requirements.  If the prosecution is requesting you submit to one, it is usually to gather evidence against you.  However, according to your question, it is your attorney that is recommending it.  Not knowing the details of your case, (which I share concerns of peers, that you not provide any further sensitive details here),  your criminal defense attorneys must have reasons why they are recommending the test.   Those reasons may or may not include helping you establish innocence or challenging accuracy of the prosecutions evidence.   So before you raise any further objections or make a decision,  I would definitely encourage you to discuss your concerns and the reasons your attorney is recommending it directly with them.  As a word of caution, if you and and your attorney agree that the polygraph test will prove to be exculpatory in nature (prove you are innocent), you do not want to give the prosecution another reason to argue that the polygraph evidence is inaccurate.  This is definitely a question for you and your defense advocate to discuss and agree upon based on the criminal defense case your attorney is building on your behalf, and the sensitive details of your case.

Filing a provisional patent application that describes an invention does not change that reality.   What you have to sell is not the patent application but: (1) INFORMATION about your invention is made, how it's used, and how it works and  (2) the very unlikely POTENTIAL that after three years and about $15K in patent application costs a patent will issue with commercially-useful claims describing a commercially-attractive product that can be made, distributed, marketed and sold for at least half again its cost, AND you will have to find a buyer who values the patent protection AND has the financial wherewithal to enforce the patent if need be.  All of the above is not meant to dissuade you from trying to sell the INFORMATION and the POTENTIAL for patent protection. Your sales pitch, however, should be focused in the invention and not the provisional patent application [which, yes, can be sold].  Good luck."

If you were renting a car before and now the vehicle payment is about the same you are in the same position IF YOU DONT DEFAULT. Noone can say what a judge would do or how much they would agree to.. I bet if it was a $10,000 car and $250 in payments they would say yes..but I don't know and a 100% case with 2 years into it puts you in a great position.   Finally, the biggest reason is whether or not any one objects! If no objection, then I don't know you filed the proposed order or your local rule on that.

The prosecutor cannot file charges until they receive a case from the detective. As a former domestic violence prosecutor, I can understand your frustration with the process. The judge who issued the order is relatively powerless to do anything that would satisfy you and make you feel safe, so you are left waiting for the detective to finish his investigation and then waiting for a prosecutor to make a charging decision. Even when a prosecutor decides to charge him, don't expect that it means he will go to jail to await trial. Most defendants are released while they await the outcome of the case. Even domestic violence defendants. If you are already working with advocates, I commend you. They can help you with services to safety plan for your family regardless of what happens to the criminal case.

1819085,"I am assuming when you say ""owner"" you are referring to the landlord and not a tenant on the lease.  That being said, the general answer is that a tenant has an expectation of privacy in his/her dwelling and that police need a warrant or exigent circumstances to enter.  This is why several attorneys have indicated they need more facts to assess your question.  We would need to how the police justify entrance into the apartment.  So, for example if there was a reason to believe that a fleeing felon had entered the property or evidence was being destroyed, a court may find the entry was justified.  Most landlords reserve the right to enter for maintenance, but that would probably not justify allowing police to enter and search."
1820966,"First, you don't want to do a ""motion"" for discovery.  You just ""request"" discovery.  You file a ""motion"" when you want the courts to order something to happen.  The prosecution has a responsibility to provide you discovery, so you just request it from the appropriate authority.  If it fails to give you discovery, you can motion the court to ""compel production of discovery"" and/or ""motion to dismiss for failure to provide discovery.""  So, you won't want to combine your discovery request and your motion against the ticket.  You'll want to get discovery, do your own investigation, and determine whether you really have a viable motion against the ticket for failure to meet all the conditions precedent to citing you.  What exactly would the motion be called?  Well, often in criminal defense you create your own animal when challenging the sufficiency of state actions.  You can probably entitle it ""motion to dismiss for failure to issue a valid ticket.""  Or something to that effect.  I don't know that you'll find forms for such a motion.  You can, if you want, look up the Uniform Trial Court Rules and the Supplementary Local Rules of the jurisdiction you are in to determine how such motions should be formatted.  But I wouldn't really recommend that you do that on your own.  What I would recommend is that you consult with an attorney for at least an hour.  If you want to handle your case on your own, but would like help drafting your motion, it could very well be worth whatever that costs to ensure that your motion is properly formatted.  Many attorneys will offer free consultations, and it shouldn't take too many hours to draft such a motion (though I haven't actually seen your case file or fact pattern, so I really don't know how many hours it would take to draft it).  You are going about this correctly so far.  You should also look at ORS 810.439 for extra conditions precedent.  Best of luck!"

1784827,"Are you saying that your client wants to sue you for what your independent contractor did?   Without seeing what your agreements are with both the client and the independent contractor, it's hard to give a detailed answer, but generally speaking, your obligations to your client would be spelled out in your agreement with the client. If you have someone who is working for you as an agent (your independent contractor), you may be liable to the client for damages caused by your agent. (Whether they're an agent is a question of fact, and how your contract with the independent contractor is phrased might not be enough - it depends on how you control their actions).   If you do get sued by your client for what your independent contractor did, you'd want to seek what's called indemnification from that independent contractor. That means that if they do something that you end up on the hook for, they're required to reimburse you under your contract with them. Does your contract provide for indemnification? However, the question is whether that indemnification clause means anything from a practical perspective - i.e., do they have the money?   Bottom line, however, is no one WANTS to sue. Litigation is costly for everyone, so make sure that you're timely responding to communications with the client and keeping an open and honest dialogue. If you think that's not working and this might be headed towards a lawsuit, hire an attorney for guidance."

As an aside, I think unauthorized practice is at best punishable as a misdemeanor and not a felony; and in the circumstances here (fiancee and limited to one matter), I don't think any City Attorney or District Attorney would take the time to pursue charges.

1947953,"This event is made available for use at the end of a Chapter 13 plan, as part of the process of determining whether or not a mortgage is current. A trustee is supposed to file a Notice of Final Cure Payment when, during the Chapter 13 plan, they believe that a mortgage is current. In WA the trustee is guaranteed to know this as if a mortgage is in arrears (behind) mortgage payments are required to be made through the plan. In a district like your own, this isn't guaranteed and therefore the debtor is required to take an extra step. The Notice must be filed by the trustee within 30 days after the debtor completes all payments under the plan.  If the debtor believes that the final cure payment has already been made and that all plan payments have been completed; the debtor can 9but is not required) to file and serve the Notice if the trustee does not do so within the 30 day period.  The mortgage holder is required to file a Response to Notice of Final Cure Payment within 21 days of service of the Notice; this means you. Even if you do not dispute the Notice you MUST file this response. If you dispute the notice, a Motion for Determination of Final Cure and Payment can be filed by you or the trustee to request that the Court set a hearing in order to make a determination on the status of the mortgage."

In all 3 events you face fines ad court costs on top of what I have outlined, and, regardless of which you choose, in all 3 cases you must make an election within 30 days of issuance of the citation.

And the bank can foreclose on the security at any time (so long as they've given you proper notice) but cannot attempt to recover any mortgage payments or pursue any other fees against you. If they choose to let you stay, they can't later try to recover costs.  Keep in mind that the bank can foreclose and at some point someone at the bank will decide it's time to do something about the debt. Once that occurs, you may get another foreclosure notice and may have to find alternative living accomodations.  We've seen these types of situations go on for 4-5 years in some cases."

1793079,"We here are really not a research pool where we field questions about terms of art and then expound on them. You are entering an arena of statutes written as a result of federal mandates and state-level compromises arrived at to implement the federal mandates. So the statutes are convoluted and have driven you here for an explanation of a meaning.  The ""bar"" appears in FCA å¤451:     2. (a) The court may modify an order of child  support,  including  an order  incorporating  without merging an agreement or stipulation of the parties, upon a  showing  of  a  substantial  change  in  circumstances.  Incarceration  shall  not  be  a  bar to finding a substantial change in circumstances  provided  such  incarceration  is  not  the   result   of non-payment  of  a  child  support  order,  or  an  offense  against the custodial parent or child who is the subject of the order or judgment.  The section empowers the family court to have continuing jurisdiction to increase or decrease its orders of child support throughout the life of the support case.  In order to increase or decrease the amount of the order, the litigant has to show a ""substantial change in circumstances"" for the court to increase or decrease the order. Even jailing does not stop the possibility of a finding of a substantial change of circumstances to increase or decrease the order. The two exceptions to this are 1. that the jailing arose from a violation of an order of support and 2. that the jailing occurred as a result of domestic violence against the other parent or the child.  I am not certain how this can help you. You appear to need assistance in overall representation because you may not realize what you are doing in court. The other parent apparently beat you up and landed in jail because of that and you agreed to drop the child support payment to $25 per month. Many litigants tell me they cannot afford me. They then go to family court and demolish their chances at obtaining fair and adequate support for their child. The less they pay me, the more they lose for their child.  You have no need to know the statute because you voluntarily reduced the amount of support the other parent is supposed to pay to the New York State minimum -- $25 per month. His jailing was not a substantial change of circumstances to decrease or increase the order of support (because apparently he beat you up) but you reduced it any way, voluntarily. An order on consent requires a higher burden to vacate. You helped him out enormously in spite of FCA å¤451 which a jurisdictional statute affecting the ability of the court to enter orders. Your consent allowed the court to do so waiving the jurisdictional bar.  I do not see the terms ""certain conditions"" in FCA å¤451 and I do not see them in the Domestic Relations Law Section 236B so I cannot opine on this now. In the end, the more you represent yourself, the more money you will lose over the twenty one years of the life of the New York child support order."
1830226,"The period of the lease is insignificant, aside from the fact that if it is longer than 6 months it needs to be in writing.  Any month that the tenant is not staying in for the full month should be pro-rated, however, if something else is otherwise agreed upon, a court will enforce it.  That said, I think he would have a tough time enforcing this (it would cost him more to try to enforce it than he would win if he prevailed) if you stayed the full term, paid on time, and paid the pro-rated portion of your last month on the way out."

1318766,"Dear Hopewell Junction Landlord:  Without a lease provision authorizing self-help in the event of nonpayment of rent, locking out your commercial tenant would be considered a breach of lease, void the obligation to pay rent, and subject the landlord to a lawsuit for damages by reason of the illegal eviction, breach of lease, loss of business opportunity and perhaps far more.  No New York landlord is allowed to conduct an eviction without the use of the court where there is no lease based on nonpayment of rent. Were that not the law, then no landlord would ever face the consequence of an eviction done without a court proceeding.  If you want to end the tenancy, serve a termination of tenancy notice as provided in New York Real Property Law Section 232-b, and at the end of the period set in the notice, commence the summary holdover eviction proceeding.  Or, proceed in the manner most landlords would undertake when the tenant fails to pay the rent. Serve a proper written rent demand, and on the expiration of the three day period provided in the rent demand, if the tenant does not pay or does not move, commence your summary nonpayment proceeding.   Good luck."
1805689,"You can file a lawsuit in Superior Court for replevin. You can ask the Court for an order to allow you access to the property to collect your things. You start a lawsuit like this with a letter, and you have it delivered by mail, and posted on his door and with any luck have the letter handed to him. It needs to tell him, very clearly, that you want your stuff back and if you have to go to court to get an order so you can get it back, the court can make him pay your reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit for acting so badly and putting you to so much trouble over your personal property. The Court can tell the police to give you a civil standby if necessary.   Make a list of what is yours before you go. Give your ex the opportunity to hand it over voluntarily. If he does not hand over your stuff voluntarily, make it cost him money. In a replevin suit, if things of yours are missing and he doesn't hand them over to you, then he can pay you the value of what he refused to hand over.   Elizabeth Powell"

879896,"I agree with Mr. Sampair.  It sounds like you have a very good case for relocation, since there are no other options in front of you and the father is not a good option, either.

1803490,"Being able to parent is a fundamental constitutional right, one that the Court will not extinguish without very good cause.   At some point, however, his conduct would constitute ""abandonment"" and could be the basis for a legal action to terminate his parental rights.    If you want to move (sounds like across the border into Idaho), file the required Notice of Intended Relocation.  Since he has not seen your child for many years, the Court is not likely to give much weight to any objection he may file.   But since all of the facts and court papers are not available in this forum, I would encourage you to consult with an experienced family law attorney in your area who can provide more specific advice."
1804975,"This does not require a separate lawsuit.  It is awarded by Motion with a supporting affidavit,  but if you wait, you will lose your right to seek a judgment for costs.  Also review the Civil Procedure rules on allowable costs.  You will find that most of what you think of as costs (lost time, work, travel, etc.) are normally not costs that the court will award to you.  Consult with a lawyer if you have any doubts about a proper motion, or what are awardable costs."
1794751,"Unless you are an attorney, you are permitted to contact the Board in general accordance with the covenants.  That does not give you the right to harass them and their can be some reasonable limitations.  There are ways under GA law and typically the HOA covenants to obtain information.  In general, some of the larger firms who represents HOA (a factory business) try to impose themselves , delay and intimidate.   If you have serious questions, there are ways to fight the HOA from internet campaigns, neighborhood coordination, etc.  It often can take a coordinated effort of legal and practical actions and building support but it can be done.  I have successfully done it as a resident myself.  As a practical matter, it may not make you very popular with some more vocal groups so you will need a tough skin."
1797179,Probably not.  I think you will be hard-pressed to prove you are entitled to damages when you could just as well have still been in federal prison rather than in the HH.  I'm curious to know how a convicted federal felon gets a 100k/year job.  What was the job?  Did they know of your criminal history??
1828747,I agree with Ms Silverman but I would add that if the apartment is illegal you are entitled to a relocation allowance from the LL under Nj law. It is equal to six months rent. Get proof the rental is illegal and stop paying rent. The landlord will sue to evict. At trial bring forward the proof. The court should not issue a removal until the allowance is paid.   Alternately you can sue in Special Civil Part. You need to get a consult from an attorney about this. Most will give an initially consult free.

1801319,"No, it's not a good idea at all, and to persist will get you nowhere. DACAs are currently taking 7-8 months to be processed nationwide, and that's if there is no RFE issued.  The constant deluge of DACAs without increase in adjudication officers have the unwanted effect of further clogging and slowing an already dysfunctional immigration application processing system. US citizens filing for their spouses overseas and in the US have been literally screaming at USCIS for some time now, and apparently all they get in response is something like ""the DACA deluge that has been imposed upon us"". Consequently any complaints on your part will not elicit any sympathy or action from USCIS."

1792215,"You need to vigorously object to the move-away. If you do so, you can ask that custody be transferred to you if she chooses to move. You need an attorney to do this; once she gets permission to move the kid out of the county, its game over on that issue."
1818871,"Do you have a court order regulating custody or is it an agreement?  Is the distance from your home to the new residence in Va extremely long or is he just over the border within an hour from W-S?  If he is close, there is no reason why visits cannot be arranged by meeting halfway...unless you are adamant that he provide all transportation.  If he has moved much farther away, then he should bear the burden of most visits.  You may have to attempt to renegotiate the agreement or file a motion to modify the order based on the move if the move has some detrimental effect on the child as regards transportation and logistics.  Contact and consult with  a local family law attorney to get more detailed advice."
1828971,"Lockouts are always unlawful. You can be asked to leave - usually a 20-day notice. a 20-day must be served within the first ten days of the month to be effective the last day of the month. If you are served with a 20-day, make other plans to reside elsewhere. If you think your roommate owes you money because you paid all the rent for four months, you can sue your roommate. But an unlawful detainer is a series of trick questions: Did you stay after you got a proper 20-day notice? If yes, you are going to be evicted. That's it and there is no point arguing with the calendar.   There is no counterclaim allowed in unlawful detainer. There is nothing for you to file. If you stay, you will have a permanent black mark on your rental history. Don't do that.   You can move out and sue him for trying to evict you without the benefit of a judge and a sheriff, but you cannot do this while you reside in his property. Elizabeth Powell"
1506934,You would have received a citation by now most likely. You don't have to pay the civil demand either.
1790714,"It is unfortunate to hear of your troubles with your landlord.  Any UD action should be taken seriously and you should consider hiring an attorney to assist you in fighting it, if that is what you chose to do. Without knowing more facts about your situation I feel as though any opinion I would give regarding your questions about named parties on the 3 day notice or service might not be on point.    With that said here is some information that the courts provide on the 3 day pay or quit notice  There are 3 ways to serve the notice:  Personal service: You or someone else gives the notice directly to the tenant in person. Substituted service: If the tenant is not home, you can leave the notice with a member of the household, at least 18 years old, where the tenant lives AND then mail a second copy to the tenant at the property. Posting and mailing (""nail and mail"") service: If there is no one home to leave the papers with, you can tape or nail the notice to the front door or somewhere where it can be seen easily AND send a copy by mail to the tenant at the property.  You can find more information on what is required from the landlord at  http://www.courts.ca.gov/1288.htm  As far as the Demurrer it is an option to file but in order to give my opinion I would need additional facts, such as where you ever mailed the 3 day notice or was anyone, not a minor, at your residence ever given the notice.   Good luck to you."

1801625,"I don't necessarily agree with the other posts.  While the FDCPA certainly can apply to the collection of a judgment, if YOU have a judgment against someone and YOU are the one attempting to collect, you are not a debt collector under the FDCPA or any state law that I've heard of.  The laws typically only apply to third party collection agents.  That's when those laws come into effect.  So long as you do not make any threats, etc. against the debtor, YOU should not have any issues."
1827634,Check with the Los Angeles Housing Department to make sure you are getting the full amount of relocation assistance and storage costs that you are entitled to.

1789527,"You have to financially qualify for a public defender.  The court will ask for your financial information and determine whether you qualify or not.  If you do, they'll appoint the PD.    A couple of considerations before deciding what to do:  First - you only have 10 days from the date of your arrest to request a hearing with the DMV or they will automatically suspend your license for four months. The public defender cannot and will not be involved in the DMV proceedings as they are administrative and not criminal in nature. Besides, by the time you go to court, your timeframe to contact the DMV will have come and gone.  A private attorney, on the other hand, can and will assist with the DMV hearings. There may be strategic maneuvers and questioning done at the DMV hearing that set you up for a better outcome in criminal court.  Before deciding that you cannot afford an attorney, use your time wisely and contact a few good local criminal defense attorneys to discuss your case, any possible defenses and payment arrangements.  What I have written in no way is meant to suggest that public defenders cannot or will not do a good job on your DUI case in court. It's just that you have things that happen quickly and before the court case starts that are just as important to you."
1812067,"if you settled with American Express, why are they still collecting on the judgment. What proof do you have that you settled this specific account. You will need to get proof that you settled this specific account and provide it to the collector/attorney and follow through with them.

1822750,"Many of your complaints are the reason that the Appeal process exists. Since you indicated that you expect to finally be approved, it sounds like the appeal process has finally provided the type of relieve that it is meant to. The clerical errors that you mentioned unfortunately occur, and are part of the reason that Social Security places so many checks and balances. I do not believe that you will have any type of claim that would provide you with any financial recourse because of the errors that were previously made by the Social Security Administration, DDS, or the Administrative Law Judges. The best thing that you can do is to notify your congressional representatives of the obstacles that are face by individuals that are going through this process.  In terms of your Legal Representatives, you allege some serious accusations of ethical violations. Falsifying contracts and failure to prepare for your hearing are both serious matters. Social Security has a code of conduct that attorneys and non-attorney representatives must follow in order to be permitted to practice before the Social Security Administration. Violation of the Code of Conduct can be reported to the Social Security Administration by following the instructions on its website (http://www.ssa.gov/representation/conduct_standards.htm). If the representatives are also licensed attorneys, most states also have a State Disciplinary Office that complaints of attorney unethical behavioral can be reported to (Texas: http://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForLawyers/GrievanceInfoandEthicsHelpline/OfficeOfCDC.htm). Finally you can also contest the attorney fee agreement if it is approved by the ALJ. When the decision is issued, you will have 15 days to file a request to review the attorney fee if you feel that your attorney did not provide you with adequate representation. It is also possible to file a malpractice claim against your attorney, but you might find that there is not a case for malpractice if you are approved for benefits and have no real damages.  I wish you good luck. Before pursuing any other remedies, I would agree with the other attorneys that caution that any further action may be for nothing. Sometimes accepting the positive (the eventual approval) and moving on from what has occurred is the best course of action."
1798417,"Are you thinking about asylum?  You can apply for asylum in the US if you have a ""well-founded fear of persecution"" in your country based on (1) political opinion, (2) religion, (3) race, (4) nationality, or (5) membership in a particular social group.   There is no government filing fee for applying for asylum.  If you are outside the US, you may apply for refugee status based on these same criteria. Your fear of persecution must be either by the government of your country or by a group that the government is unable or unwilling to control.   If you are able to establish past persecution, a presumption arises that you have established a well-founded fear of persecution. The burden of proof shifts to the government to demonstrate that circumstances have changed and that you no longer have a well-founded fear of persecution or that you could avoid persecution by relocating in another part of your country and that it would be reasonable for you to do so.   If you are in lawful immigration status, you can submit an application for asylum (Form I-589) directly with the appropriate Asylum  USCIS Service Center specified in the instructions. Should your application be denied, you will remain in lawful status.   However, if you are not in lawful status, should your asylum application not be approved by the USCIS, you will be placed in removal proceedings. If you are in removal proceedings before an Immigration Judge, in addition to applying for asylum, you may be eligible to apply for withholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)."
954060,"The one thing my colleagues have not mentioned is that IF the court determines the ONLY reason you appealed was to delay the inevitable or that the appeal was brought in bad faith, the court can award up to $1000 in travel costs/lost wages AND up to $1000 in attorney's fees to the plaintiff (CCP 116.790).  If there is no REAL basis for your appeal, then as my colleague has suggested, file a motion to pay the judgment in installments.  If you have further questions, be sure to speak with a lawyer that knows about Small Claims."
1819270,"It is impossible to answer this question without reviewing the actual court order.  Many times when lawsuits involve land, they apply to anyone who owned the land and who was involved in the lawsuit, but then the court order binds other interested parties or successors-in-interest -- this means, anyone who later purchases the property or whose property is served by the right of way.  Many times these orders are recorded in the land records to give people notice of what restrictions affect the land.    Unfortunately, the devil is in the details in this instance -- we'd have to see why the lawsuit was brought about in the first place and why the judge crafted the order the way he did.  I wish I could offer you more information, but any lawyer would have to sit down and review the order as well as other documents filed in the case to give you an answer."
1785924,"I agree with Mr. Pate. It is difficult to understand what you are posting and I am familiar with Missouri's Casenet. What might have happened, and this is speculation on my part, is that originally a charge was filed and warrant issued with bond set. However, at a later date, the prosecutor decided to pull the case from the docket where it would have eventually ended up in a preliminary hearing and put it in front of the Grand Jury where it might be easier to get the indictment. At the very least, you should consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney. Most will provide a free consultation. That way you can find out what you are facing and the attorney can quote a fee for what he or she would charge you if you hired them"

249915,"To become a public defender you have to first become a lawyer.   To become a lawyer in Florida you have to obtain a 4 year bachelors degree in some course of study, preferably social sciences of some kind.  Then you take a law school entrance exam call the LSAT.  If you receive a high enough score you apply to various law schools for admission.  Once admitted to a law school you study law for 3 years or so in order to receive your degree in law call a Juris Doctorate.   After graduating from law school you are required to take a set of exams given by the Florida Bar to determine whether you learned enough law in law school to be admitted to practice law in Florida. But it isn't enough just to pass the bar exams, you will also be screened for character.  People who have arrest records or mental or substance abuse problems will usually not be admitted to the bar.  So don't get into any trouble on your road to becoming a lawyer.  If you pass the bar exams and the screening, you will then be sworn in to practice law by the Florida Supreme Court.  You are a lawyer.   Next, you have to apply for a job at a public defender office.    I believe the associates degree in liberal arts offered by Polk State College is your first step.  There will be guidance counselors there at Polk State College.  Find one and tell him/her what you are trying to do.  Talk to people there and get as much information as possible.  Be prepared to study hard and to dedicate the next 7 or so years of your life to your dream.  It's not as hard as it sounds.  Its done all the time by young people like you.  And when you are sworn in don't lose your idealism.  Ours is a service profession, make it proud of you.  Good luck and God bless."

In regards to student loans, if you co-signed them  you are fully responsible for payment and can be subject to the full range of collection available, which will depend on whether these are private lenders or govenment guaranteed /subsidized loans. There are limited cases where an individual may apply for loan forgiveness,  due to disability etc. To the extend you do pay on the loans you will have a claim against him for reimbursement. This claim may have a different statue of limitations then for the money you loaned him. You should also weigh the costs of collection versus the likelihood of recover.    Your best scenario would be for the student loans to be able to collect from him, no cost to you. So it may be worth providing informatin to the loan companies to facilitate collection from him."

2269765,I agree with Attorney Moss.  On the surface of things placing a camera in the common area to monitor a pool is considered a reasonable step to monitor the compliance with the association's rules.  At the board meeting you may want to ask what the date was that the cameras were approved and ask for the minutes of that meeting.  The minutes should provide the reasons for their placement and reveal if any board member voted against the proposal.  Other questions you may want to know the answer to: who monitors the recordings and when; what happens to the recordings (do they expire after a certain amount of days) and can the board determine who has access and whether downloading of has occurred.  Submit these questions in writing at least 7 days before the meeting you are going to attend and ask that they be put on the agenda.  Without being on the agenda the board is not allowed by law to answer the questions until the issue is put on an agenda.  Good fortune!

They apply only when full payment has not been made upon termination of the employment relationship.  However, Ca. Lab. Code å¤204 requires that you be paid twice a month (with some exceptions, which you should examine whether they apply). Although it doesn't come with its own penalty provision, the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (""PAGA"") applies a penalty to such improper payment. It's not much: $100 for the first violation, and $200 for each successive violation. Since the statute of limitations is 1 year for penalties, the most you could recover would be $2300.  But if there are numerous employees in the same situation, the value might become attractive to an attorney.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Sincerely, Craig T. Byrnes"

Do tell them you are meeting with a bankruptcy attorney shortly and to wait one moth before contacting you and hang up!    Enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what. Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can. You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

2475786,"You might well have a claim.  Normally, you are not entitled to any severance as a general rule of thumb unless you have an employment contract with a negotiated severance provision.  However, the auto accident might place you in a protected class due to either the use of FMLA leave, or because the injuries confer disability protection under the ADA or state law.  If your peers were relocated to open positions, or even just paid more severance, that could be evidence of discrimination."
1344116,"The real value of this question is that it teaches lessons, although the lessons carry consequences that are very harsh.   The first lesson is, ""No good deed goes unpunished.""  This refers of course to your generosity in ""ending things amicably,"" by giving her half your personal injury settlement, thinking, perhaps, what?  It's only fair?  Or, Why spend money fighting in court?   Or, I think she'll get half anyway, which I suppose now you realize isn't correct.   But then, her answer to that was ""drop dead,"" when time came for her to be generous, so your good deed was well punished.  Second, I bet you did all this without the help of a lawyer.  When you choose to do that, you're actually acting as your own attorney, and the applicable lesson is:  ""He who represents himself has a fool for a client and an incompetent for a lawyer.""  Your lawyer would have had much better answers on what she would get of your personal injury settlement, although not all the lawyers on the site agree with each other about that, (or with me).  Still, they're all giving you better advice than you got from the lawyer you had, which we now know was you.  When you go to court without a lawyer, you pay the consequences.  Tough lessons, right?   Hard to tell if you've got ""any recourse"" because I can't tell the stage of the proceedings.  Why don't you see a lawyer now and ask him/her?  If the answer is, ""I can't afford a lawyer,"" ask yourself this:  How much did it cost to represent yourself?   You may end up paying more to NOT have one than to pay one up front.  Last lesson:  Pay now or pay later."
1792267,"You need to contact an attorney that handles probate matters and arrange to open an estate for your grandfather (This will need to be done in the county where he resided at the time of his death.) and then for your mother.  When you meet with the attorney, bring a copy (or ideally the original of your grandfather's will) as well as a copy of any will that your mother signed.  You should also bring a list of your grandfather's relatives who were alive at the time of his death and all of your mother's living relatives.  After you meet with the probate attorney, ask for an estimate of the cost of handling both matters and only hire the attorney, if you are comfortable with the fee arrangement.  If you don't reach a satisfactory agreement with the first attorney, keep contacting attorneys until you find one with whom you want to work, but don't let this wait any longer for resolution."

1803865,"Are you asking whether you will be notified of ""the person's"" VOP court date or the court date for the assault case?  If you mean the assault case in which you are the victim then yes, the State should notify you of that court date because you are a witness they will likely need to testify on that court date.  If you mean the VOP case then you will probably not be notified of the court date unless you are a witness for the State as to the grounds for the VOP charge."
1814340,"If there is equity in the house it is money and that is what the woman wants. Any interest your husband has directly or indirectly and any interest which he has transfered to you or into the trust within the last several years could be set aside. Your state may have exemptions or other laws which limit a creditor's ability to take an interest in a home. You should consult an experienced local bankruptcy or dent collection attorney who will be able to help you understand exemptions,  fraudulent transfers and avoidable transfer and evaluate what if any thing your husband owns or has owned or transfered that could be reached by creditors."
1664159,"If you live in IN for more than 6 months, then IN has jurisdiction over this matter.  If the father wants visitation and the child is only 5 years old, he may have to travel to IN instead of expecting the child to travel to his residence - especially since he hasn't seen the child in 3 years.  It's unlikely the child even knows the father at this point.  He will have to file a Modification Petition in WA which will be returnable in IN and you will have to respond in IN and then the IN Magistrate or judge will make a decision regarding visitation for the child.  Noramlly, such visitation will be limited until the child is older and it should remain in IN rather than the child traveling to WA.  Since he moved in the other direction, then it is his obligation to travel to see a child of such tender years.  By the way, has he been supporting the child all this time or not?  That will also play a part in the overall determination of the Court.  You may want to make a counter-Petition seeking child support at a higher amount at this point, even if he has been supporting the child if either or both of your circumstances have substantially changed.  Good luck to all three of you."
1049734,"In most states a minor who is under the ""legal age"" for that state can almost always get out of a contract as long as they can give back what they got out of the contract (if you bought a motor vehicle, and it is still in basically the same condition as it was when you got it, then you have to give it back, for example). It may not even matter if you are happy with your purchase or not. That‰Ûªs because most states consider a minor as being unable to fully understand and appreciate the legal consequences of their decisions. To find out how your state law works though, you need to talk to a local attorney who deals with this kind of case. Call your local attorney's Bar Association and ask for a referral to an attorney near you. When your problem involves a motor vehicle, can call Jon Rogers or James Taylor in Salt Lake City.

1828168,"An out-of-state creditor must domesticate a foreign state court judgment under Pennsylvania's Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act before executing against the debtor's property. (I assume this is a New Jersey state court judgment. However, a creditor with a federal court judgment from another state may domesticate a judgment by registering the judgment in the debtor's district.)  Creditors have somewhat limited enforcement ability in Pennsylvania. There is no wage garnishment in Pennsylvania for most debts, other than domestic support obligations, some fines, federal student loans, some taxes, and rent. However, a judgment creditor can levy or garnish a bank account or collect against personal property.   There are some other protections, such as tenancy by the entireties and exemptions for certain types of income (e.g., social security, government benefits, etc.) under Pennsylvania and federal law. You should speak to an attorney who understands debtor defense, debt negotiation, and bankruptcy to review your legal options for dealing with this matter."
1826233,"You absolutely should speak with an attorney ASAP to discuss your options.  It is possible you can go after your mother for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.  To get the property back, the 3rd party must have known or should have known that your mother had no right to sell (partition).  This is going to be time consuming and complicated, and if you wait, you may lose your rights to pursue the matter.  If what you are saying is true, you at least have a strong case against your mother for damages.  It would be interesting to see if you could get the property back based upon the facts of the partition."
1801900,"You can do counter-surveillance on your neighbor, but do not do so to the extent he/she has been doing it.  If they are watching you as much as you say they are then take pictures, record video with date stamp or daily newspaper in the shot.  If they are acting like peeping toms in any way you can have that restrained.  As my colleague stated however, be over prepared in your hearing to present as much evidence as possible.  You might need legal help in drafting the proposed order though.  Although you have rights, so does your neighbor.  Your neighbor can't use his home as a vantage point to make observations about you that are unreasonable."
1808459,"How far out was your trial set from the date of filing the complaint?  Some counties have backlog and trials are set as much as 18 months out from the trial setting conference.  If this is the case then it is very unlikely that the judge will give you an extension unless you have a very good reason for not completing discovery in such a long period.  However, some court assign trial dates very quickly.  I had a case where the trial date was set for only four months away.  The judge agreed to continue the trial so that we could complete discovery in order to file a motion for summary judgment.    You need to take a critical look at your timing to determine whether a judge will agree that you have a reasonable excuse for not completing discovery in time.  Perhaps you should also consider continuing the trial date by stipulation with the other parties.  Finally, there is likely a deadline imposed by the local rules of the court regarding continuing trial.   Take care of this as soon as you can."
1822386,"There are some holes that need to be filled. If you pleaded guilty on the fraud charge, what were the terms of your sentencing, and what was the reason for the court date that you missed which led to the warrant?  Public Defender's may not have the time to get back to their clients due to their high caseloads, but that does not mean that they are unreliable. What are your reasons for determining that the Public Defender is not reliable?  If the Riverside County District Attorney filed the charges, that is where you will need to defend.There may be attorneys that would be willing to take payments, but that means taking a risk of not being paid, and once they become attorney of record, they may be locked into the case by the court whether or not they are compensated. If you truly have no money or job, the Public Defender is probably your best bet, and in my observation they are typically very reliable, they just may not have the time to be as attentive as private counsel."
1295762,"First, contact your local building department to see if an out house is acceptable within the local building codes. Besides local restrictions, if you are in or near a forest, federal jurisdiction may come in to play as well. Make sure you check with all government agencies who have regulating authority. If an out house doesn't work for them, have them consider a port-o-potty with a makeshift shower as another option. If you don't get a permit the government can claim environmental harm and impose substantial fines and onerous mitigation measures."

1805744,"Its a bankruptcy question and not a teal estate question.  If younsigned a forma Reaffirmation Agreement that was filed with the court then you agreed to pay the mortgage in spite of the bankruptcy. That means that not only can they now foreclose,  they can now sue you for any balqnce due after the foreclosure.  Since a creditor is prohibited from contacting you about your debt after bankruptcy unless you did sign a Reaffirmation Agreement and the mortgage company is still contacting you, it looks like you did sign that Agreement. If you did, I think you should try to bring your payments current unless you just give up.  If you find out that you did not sign the Agreement then your mortgage payments after the bankruptcy were just ""gifts"" and you can just walk away from it now."

I do not know how they would be entitled to garnish your wages, or what the debt was for, but I suggest you consult with a lawyer who specializes in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  Calling your job and threatening you or your employer with garnishment sounds like a violation of the FDCPA especially if you paid them off 5 months ago. This smells like a shakedown."
1791923,"SR is an abbreviation for Safety Responsibility.   The Texas Department of Public Safety administers driver's licenses in the state of Texas.  It sounds like you were required to have specialized insurance AKA SR-22.  DPS can be contacted and they will tell you how to clear up your license.  This may mean paying surcharges, obtaining specialized insurance, taking Driver's Safety Course and or other hoops to jump through.  You may even have to file for an occupational driver's license.  Call DPS, visit one of their offices, or go to their website.  IF you still feel overwhelmed and confused, you can hire an attorney to find out answers for you. FYI this is probably more expensive."
1826828,"Although it may be annoying, your neighbor is allowed to install cameras that cover areas that would be open to public view.  The camera facing the street is allowed. Most likely the camera facing the side of your house is also allowed.  If that part of your house is visible from the street, sidewalk, alley, etc., then it would be considered to be within a public area.  There is probably not much you could do about this. Since the mother is falsely accusing you, this may actually be a blessing.  The cameras may conceivably establish that you did not trim the backyard vines.   By the way, if the vines intrude onto your property, as long as you do not harm or kill them by doing so, you can trim the parts on your side of the fence."

1784658,"While I generally agree with Mr. Harvey, things are somewhat more lax in the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (UIAB) hearings. More often than one would expect, a UIAB administrative law judge will grant relief for ""good cause,"" as that term is defined by the the UIAB Precedent Benefit Decisions.    The Notice of Determination stating your claim was denied includes information about the appeal. You MUST file your appeal within 20 days of the date stated in that letter. Do not miss the deadline. In the appeal, make a brief statement saying why you believe the denial was incorrect. Save your detailed argument and evidence for the hearing. For example: ""I had good cause to miss the deadline or not notify EDD of my interest in training.""   In a few weeks, you will receive notice of an appeals hearing with the date, time and location. At the hearing, be prepared with as much evidence as possible to establish good cause. You should also know the law the administrative law judge will consider. You can get a lot of helpful information on the EDD website.  Home page http://www.edd.ca.gov/Unemployment/ Eligibility requirements http://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/Eligibility.htm Summaries of the law (Benefit Determination Guide) http://www.edd.ca.gov/UIBDG/  Appeals http://www.edd.ca.gov/Unemployment/FAQ_-_Appeals.htm Precedent Decisions (law the administrative law judges rely on) http://www.cuiab.ca.gov/precedent_decisions.shtm  Frequently asked questions http://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/FAQs.htm Filing a claim for unemployment benefits http://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/Filing_a_Claim.htm  You can be represented by anyone at the hearing. If your appeal will be difficult or you are uncomfortable speaking, you may wish to retain an attorney to help you prepare or to represent you. For training, expect the attorney to need approximately three hours. For hearing representation, expect the attorney to need three to seven hours to prepare, depending on the complexity of the case, witnesses, documents and other evidence, and allow two hours for the hearing itself. Unemployment hearings usually last one hour or less, but you must arrive early to look at the file and there is a possibility you will have to wait for the previous case to finish.   Generally, as of 2014, plaintiffs employment attorneys in California charge between $250 and $700 per hour for legal services. The amount varies based on experience, location, attorney availability, attorney interest in the case, complexity of the matter, and more. To find a plaintiffs employment attorney in California, visit the California Employment Lawyers Association (CELA) at www.cela.org. CELA is the largest and most influential bar association in the state for attorneys representing working people. You can search for attorneys by location and practice area. Many CELA attorneys represent clients throughout the state.  Marilynn Mika Spencer  San Diego, CA"
1108866,"You have struck one of my pet peeves.  Federal Court judicial officers usually prepare their own orders.  The Court for your case might have ""local rules"" addressing the procedure for this, and http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=five&linkid=rule5_125 sets forth the State procedural rule for this.   In the San Diego Courts, attorneys often default on their obligations in this regard and often enough are allowed by the Court to withdraw from these cases without having completed their obligations and enforcement is lax.  However, the State is insolvent and now doesn't have the staff to do this work.  Perhaps clients and attorneys alike should be more frugal on the burdens they impose on our underfunded Courts."

1808695,"I agree with the previous answers and the company must be licensed in Washington to contact the residents to collect debt, furthermore you are not responsible for anyone's debts but your own. You need to consult with a consumer protection or bankruptcy lawyer locally for private and specific advice on your particular issues.    Many lawyers on this site offer a free consultation and you can find one near you, make an appointment for legal counseling, and take your paperwork and a written chronological summary. 1. Keep a detailed log of all calls and letters and a paper file of all information.  Because persistent violations of the FDCPA are punishable by statutory fines and attorney‰Ûªs fees under federal law, but you need hard evidence.    2. Make a written demand that all further communications from creditors is in writing under 15 USC 1692 (c).  The letter should also contain a dispute of the validity of the charges and include a demand for a complete accounting with signatures, and all contents of their file.  The creditor then has 30 days to reply and they may take no action until you have been sent the validation.  Remember this may be motivation for the collector to work your account when the file comes to them from the original creditor with new information pressure from the original creditor to collect.  3. Do not give them any personal information because that is how collectors decide on which accounts to recommend suing.  Remember they may not tell the truth and will say just about anything to get a payment from you and that payment reaffirms the debt, gives them information about you and your bank and ability to pay.    4. If you will make payments use money orders only and never personal checks, wire transfers, money grams, or ""check by phone."" If the collector finds a bank account, the collector will be more likely recommend a lawsuit to their legal department.   5. Collections are negotiable; the original creditor has given up and is losing up to 50% on the face value already either by splitting any return or selling at a huge discount.  In addition, the costs of a lawsuit although discounted still are a factor in the decision to settle with you. If you will settle mark the check ""settled-in-full"" at the very top back of the check and include a letter explaining that you are offering a settlement, keep copies of everything.  6. Get written confirmation of any payment plan the agency will accept before making a payment. 7. Specify in writing that all payments shall apply to principle first. If you‰Ûªre ready to throw in the towel, go see a local bankruptcy attorney and explore your options for federal protection.  The protection will even look back 90 days from filing, take back money by the collectors, and apply it fairly.  DO NOT use a paid debt settlement service; most are scammers.

1819301,"Is there a court order in place defining the terms of custody? if so, does that order specify drop off and pick-up locations?  If he has made physical threats, you may want to file for a restraining order, (which does not physically protect you, it is just a piece of paper, so be careful). Often, pick-up and drop-off transfers can be ordered to occur at public places or at police or sheriff stations to insure that things do not get out of control.  The bottom line is that there needs to be more specific information, and there is a good chance that you do not need to disclose where you live if you can establish a fear for your safety. I would suggest that you get the court involved and have an order issued to establish the facts. And by all means, if you think you and/or your child is in danger get into court immediately to modify the shared custody. If you cannot afford an attorney, check with the court's self help center."

Dad's POA would no longer have access to funds since they're all moved out of dad's name.

If she had sufficient funds and other property to cover any debts and expenses that have arisen or may arise, then you should be able to receive the property outright fairly soon.  But if she has debts and expenses that exceed her available funds, the property may have to be partitioned and sold to cover her debts from her å_ ownership in the property.

2026572,"In Massachusetts, a landlord may not evict you for reporting a suspected lead paint violation or any other health code violation to the Board of Health or other agency. Such action is generally considered a retaliatory eviction, and it can have serious consequences for the landlord. Broadly speaking, if a landlord tries to evict a tenant within 6 months after the tenant has complained to the Board of Health or other such similar agency regarding the existence of code violations at the rental unit (e.g. lead paint where a child under 6 is living in the apartment) there is a presumption that such action is retaliatory in nature, and the landlord could be liable to the tenant for up to 3 months rent, plus attorneys fees and costs, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186 s. 18.   The presumption can be rebutted if the landlord shows that he or she was evicting the tenant for justifiable reasons such as nonpayment of rent, but based on your question it appears that you are current on rent, and in any event you may be entitled to withhold rent if there are significant code violations in existence at your apartment. Also, you may have a separate cause of action for discrimination if the landlord is attempting to evict you because you are asserting your rights as a tenant under the law, particularly based on the facts you outline.   If the landlord has filed a complaint to evict you, also called a summary process action, it is important that you file an answer and/or counterclaim to avoid a default judgment if you seek to contest the eviction. Such a filing is very time sensitive and you should ensure that you act quickly to protect your rights."

If this is your only felony conviction, and you have no misdemeanor conviction carrying a 10-year ban that currently applies, then this should restore your gun rights. There are a number of qualifications and exceptions to this, so you need to speak with an attorney. Get an attorney who will fight to restore your gun rights. Good luck."

Regardless, unless you were the guarantor of your husband's medical care - meaning you are the named beneficiary of any of the medical insurance that might be liable for the bill - you have no obligation to pay this. However it is very important that you formally dispute the bill. Send a letter to the provider affirmatively stating that you dispute any liability for the bill. If you don't dispute the bill, it could end up turning up as a negative statement on your credit report.  I am sorry for your loss. This can't make it any easier."
1813411,"It's both a workers' compensation case and personal injury. There is an exclusion in workers' compensation cases for horseplay, but it does not apply IF you were not participating in the horseplay. In other words, if your co-worker just bear hugged you and you did nothing to provoke him, the horseplay defense cannot be used against you. I would not pursue the case unless you are going to be out of work for a significant amount of time while you recover. In terms of money damages in the personal injury case (it's actually the tort of battery), the amount would be determined by a jury, and could include pain and suffering. However, if this man doesn't have any assets (you say he is a poor man), recovering anything from him will be difficult (insurance wouldn't cover this type of action in most cases). Before you hire a workers' compensation lawyer, make sure you ask them what impact filing a claim will have on your job."

They get a certain number of admission tickets for their personal use that they have at least come limited ability to give to family and friends.  That said, Disney employees are STRICTLY prohibited from selling these tickets, also though there is something of a small ""black market"" where sales happen anyway.  If you have the address of the person, have you considered stopping by to get your money back?  Consider politely backing out of the deal (which is an unlawful transaction), getting yor money back and buying your tickets from Disney which, I believe, is the only place they can be purchased from despite signs around Orlando suggesting otherwise."

The plus is that you get priority examination if you include a ""glossary"" of the terms that are used in the claims of your software patent application. The minus is that you have to limit the scope of your claims when you include a ""glossary"" of the terms that are used in the claims of your software patent application. You should have a patent attorney explain why plus and why minus.   In superficially simple terms, the glossary will be used against you in litigation to restrict the scope of your claims by every defendant seeking to obtain a finding of noninfringement of those claims, as well as for you during examinations to restrict the scope of your claims for purposes of avoiding the application of prior art to those claims. So, using the glossary is a double-edged sword and should be done only by a skilled patent prosecution attorney.

1807204,"Did the trial court provide a reason for denying your motion? I ask because it is, in my experience, unusual for the court to issue a denial.    As for remedies - a writ petition might be overkill.  I would consider simply filing a motion in the court of appeal asking it to direct the trial court to grant the motion.  Whether that succeeds, of course, will depend in part on the reason, if any, for the trial court to do what it did.    Finally, please remember that you cannot rely on my post as legal advice.  The idea of filing a motion is only a suggestion, and there may be reasons why, after all, you should pursue a writ or reasons why you do not need the a summary of that hearing at all.  These are decisions that even experienced appellate lawyers think long and hard about."
1805151,"Similar inquiries have been posed to the IRS in the past and the IRS has responded. A taxpayer may deduct a contribution that is to or for the use of a church (or other charity). However for the contribution to be deductible, the church must have full control of the donated funds and discretion as to their use. This ensures that the church will use the funds to carry out the church‰Ûªs functions and purposes. In this case, it appears that the church has established a fund for the specific purpose of accepting donations to benefit the Pastor, so it would appear that the funds are being placed within the church's control as opposed to a designated gift where no such fund existed and the donor was directing the use of the funds.  However, the IRS clarified that to deduct a contribution, the donor‰Ûªs intent in making the payment must have been to benefit the church and not an individual recipient. An individual church member‰Ûªs contribution to the church that is designated for the benefit of the minister is not deductible as a charitable contribution. It is unclear to me that the establishment of this fund by the Church makes any difference to the deductibility of the gift, although clearly it will go where you intend.  When a church member wishes to provide funds for a pastor, it is best to make the gift directly to the pastor. The gifts may not be tax-deductible for the donor, bur are generally not taxable to the pastor."

First you will one year to file an action under the Private Attorney General's Act for civil penalties against your employer.  Additionally in my experience, some employers will also deduct 30 minutes from your time, even though you have worked all day, when they alter the computer records to make it appear as if you taken all your breaks.    Outside of employing a computer expert to go through the change logs on the computer, there are ways you prove you worked through your breaks.    First many fast food restaurants make you punch a number into the cash register.  This number not only appears in your timecard but also on the receipt of every customer you ring up.   Thus a receipt with your personal identification number, and  the date and time   the transaction occurred is created by the cash register. Forward transactions you ring up during your ""lunch breaks"", the cash register receipt is proof you are working. Either save the receipt or take a photo of it with your cell phone.  I agree with the other attorneys, you need to speak to a lawyer experienced in wage and hour law as soon as possible. I hope this helps."

1808792,"In New Jersey a life insurance policy with no beneficiary passes into the estate.  This means if your son had no Will, someone will need to open his estate with the Surrogate as an Administration.  If he had no spouse and no children, both parents will have equal chance to open this estate, so you had best retain an attorney who focuses his practice on Probate and Surrogate's work, as their may be a fight.  Whomever is named will first use the funds to pay his debts and creditors, which includes reimbursing whomever paid for his funeral. Then the assets will likely be divided equally between you and his dad.  If you are seen as trying to exclude the father, the Surrogate may decide to not allow you to be the Administrator, so even though you may not like it, it is best if you move forward having your attorney take the position that you understand the situation and will abide by the law.  As the Administrator, you also will receive a fee, so you can at least get that much more than his father.  I would move quickly, as the father is likely thinking of doing the same thing."

A person is not entitled to a tourist visa. The decision to issue a tourist visa is discretionary. Something in your background has triggered further scrutiny. Unfortunately, there is not enough information to try to assess why your request for a tourist visa has to be reviewed by Washington, D.C.

1804535,"I complete all documents to sign within 1 or 2 days always after client provides all . Some attorneys do  not do that quickly as they may do other areas of law, or be in court. It is up to your contract. Once filed. , the case is discharged about 105 days later approximately.   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later"
1827753,"Whether you are the plaintiff or defendant will not make a difference in terms of what happens in a divorce.  You do have a very short term marriage so there is most likely little or any alimony that will be paid, but that also depends on the specific facts of your case.  As for equitable distribution what usually happens is that any funds accumulated during the marriage, whether in joint names or one party's name, are subject to being shared.  So the fact she saved money in her name during the marriage does not mean she gets to keep it.  You are most likely entitled to a portion of what is in her bank account.  However, you really need to consult an attorney to discuss the facts of your case, but it is impossible to give you the advice you need with the limited information that is provided."

1802463,"You need to consult an experienced dependency and neglect lawyer as soon as possible.  There are too many dynamics in the situation you describe for me to provide you a complete and comprehensive answer without knowing a lot more about the case.  You should be advised that anything you say to the caseworker, or anything that you post on public internet forums like this one (if discovered), can and will be taken down and used against you in court if DHS decides to open a dependency and neglect case.  Accordingly, you should not make any sort of admissions about drug use or anything else to the caseworker or the police.  You are likely being investigated because a confidential informant reported that you are using drugs or that you appear to be under the influence around your children.  As long as there are no court orders preventing you from leaving the jurisdiction and no court case open on your children, you are free to go anywhere you wish without government interference.  Once a court case is opened however, you will not be free to take your children out of the jurisdiction without leave of the juvenile court judge or magistrate.  Additionally, you have the absolute right to not discuss anything with the department of human services and or the police, and you have the right not to consent to any searches of your home or person (including drug testing).  With that said, it is important for you to understand that should you choose not to cooperate, the caseworker will likely attempt to get an order to place the children from the juvenile court, and open a dependency and neglect case on your family.  Whether such an order is issued will depend on how much evidence the caseworker has already acquired and whether it is legally sufficient to persuade the judge to grant authority to the department of human services to place the children.  Those are your rights.  Mr. Leroi is quite correct in his answer in suggesting that child protective services has a great deal of power.  You should retain an attorney without delay.  Hope that helps.  Good luck!"

If the agreement is ambiguous (as to the employer's commitment to employ you for a specific duration) then the agreement is at will, and you are free to resign at any time. As for the ability of the employer to enjoin you from working elsewhere (if you do not complete the one year) a covenant not to compete must be found necessary to protect an employee's legitimate interest, such as protection of trade secrets, protection of confidential customer information, protection of an employee's client base or protection against irreparable harm where an employee's services are unique or extraordinary.

If so , then all you have to do is go to the court clerk's office and pay an expungement fee to have the charges removed.  If you were not on diversion then you must wait 5 years from the conviction date and then apply to have it expunged.

A building habitable or useable by humans and created after December 1, 1990 is, under copyright law, an ""architectural work"" to which copyright may attach.  Buildings created before or which are not human habitable or useable are not copyright-protected.   The scope of that copyright protection extends to ""the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design"" but does NOT include  (1) ""individual standard features"" nor  (2) the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations"" of the building if it's located in or ordinarily visible from a public place. See 17 U.S.C. sections 101 and 120(a).  Moreover, ornamental features of a building that are integrated so as to further the purpose of the building design and so form ""part of the functional and architectural vocabulary of the building"" fall within the building‰Ûªs copyright and are NOT separable works.  See, the court decision cited to via the link below.  So ‰Û_ only some buildings qualify for copyright protection and of those that do if they‰Ûªre in or ordinarily visible [i.e., not via Google Earth, etc.] from a public place it‰Ûªs lawful to sell photographs of those buildings.   The visual depiction of some buildings serve as a trademark to brand a product or service. But not many. And, in any event, a photograph of any such building would very, very likely not display the same perspective of the building or be anywhere close to presenting the same visual appearance as that used as the trademark. And even if it did, selling the photograph would very, very likely not infringe the trademark because the photograph is not the product or service being branded or one related [unless the branded product is postcards and posters in which case you shouldn‰Ûªt turn your photographs into those products].  And, moreover, a photograph is an artistic work which has its own First Amendment protection which the trademark owner would have to overcome to prove infringement. In short, there is very little risk from trademark law.  Your own intellectual property attorney must evaluate your plan, however, before you put it into action because there are always more facts in play that need to be discussed in private. Good luck."
1789686,"You hold a remainder interest in your father's home, behind your father's life estate.  Your bankruptcy lawyer advised that this had no value because it is a future interest.  I agree with all the answers provided so far, that it is a present interest that a trustee can sell.  I'll add two points.  First, I use a 50% ""marketability discount"" factor when valuing your remainder interest.  For example, property is worth $400,000 and has a $100,000 mortgage, leaving $300,000 equity.    Perhaps the IRS mortality tables suggest the life estate in the $300,000 of equity is worth $100,000 (mostly depending on your father's age). This leaves $200,000 for you and your three siblings' remainder interests.  I repeat what you've been told:  Your remainder interest is a present interest that can be sold even though you don't have any rights to possess or occupy.  $200,000 for all four siblings means your remainder interest has a ""book"" value of $50,000. The folks who will buy these interests use a 50% discount rule of thumb, meaning they might actually pay about $25,000 for your interest.  Your trustee likely will accept this from you or your family instead of trying to auction off your interest.  $25,000 is the starting point for measuring any malpractice damage - and you might ask your bankruptcy attorney to pay it.  Still, malpractice is not an easy analysis.  How much debt did you get rid of.  Could you have re-transferred your remainder interest back to your father and wait out the four year fraudulent transfer period?  The real point is whether you would have filed bankruptcy knowing that the remainder interest was at risk.  Your bankruptcy attorney did not cause that risk.  Would you have filed if you knew all this beforehand?  Good luck."

Your deal generally has to be financed within a certain period of time or else the dealer is stuck financing the deal him or herself, or you end up with a higher interest rate or more onerous terms.  In all probability you already qualified for a loan, but the dealer is angling for a higher origination fee and a higher interest rate which translates into additional gravy.  There is an article on this here:  http://www.lemonlaw.com/spotdelivery.html  You should review your contract and see if there is a cancellation clause in it. The dealer can request the car back.

In order to be successful in any medical malpractice case you have to prove that the conduct of the medical practitioner fell below the standard that was/is expected of medical practitioners of like position, place, circumstances, etc. AND that the conduct caused the death of your husband.  I am not sure how the physician could have caused the emphysema or how the doctor could have (or should have) treated your husband any different.   Additionally  you will have to make a claim with against the federal government which requires compliance with Federal Tort Claims Act.  The Federal Tort Claims Act prescribes a uniform procedure for handling of claims against the United States, for money damages only, on account of damage to or loss of property, or personal injury or death, caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of a Government employee while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.  A claim against the United States, predicated on a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs acting within the scope of his or her employment, may be filed by the injured person or his or her legal representative using Standard Form 95, Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death; however, use of the SF 95 is not mandatory, so long as the requirements are met that there is a signature of the appropriate claimant, sufficient information to investigate the allegation, and a sum certain demand.  The completed and signed claim should be submitted directly to the Regional Counsel having jurisdiction of the area wherein the occurrence complained of took place.  A tort claim must be filed within two years of the date the claim accrued. This generally means that the Regional Counsel must receive the completed claim form within two years of the accident or injury which gave rise to the claim, but may run from the time when the claimant knew or should have known of the injury.  You can also file a 1151 claim.   Title 38 U.S.C. Section 1151 allows VA to pay compensation for death or disability ""as if service-connected."" Don't be confused with this subtle difference.

Do not trust that your loan modification process will postpone or halt the foreclosure.  They may just auction your house while you are working on the loan mod - they are not required to postpone foreclosure.  The loan mod department and the foreclosure department (actually a subcontractor) are separate and do not seem to coordinate well.  The only thing you can trust regarding your foreclosure are the documents that are recorded with the county.  Keep an eye on the recorded Notices of Trustee's Sale, and cancellations of those notices.  That's the only solid way to tell whether they might auction your house soon."

1819774,"Unfortunately, it appears that you should have consulted an experienced landlord-tenant attorney before sending out the notice to quit, because the situation you have described requires that prior serving such a notice, the landlord must first serve a Notice To Cease.  Under New Jersey's Anti-Eviction Law, there are 17 enumerated causes for terminating a lease and many of them require both notices be sent before a landlord can begin eviction proceedings.  When a tenant is being accused of breaching the terms of the lease, as you are alleging here, both notices must be served in the proper sequence.  Therefore, you must first serve your tenant with a Notice to Cease, which must specify the behavior that is in breach of the lease and must demand that the tenant cease said behavior within a specified amount of time.  Once that notice is served and the time for performance has passed, then the Notice to Quit with Demand for Possession must be served.  Unless you have followed the law to the letter, the court will not have the authority to grant a judgment for possession.  Therefore, your father will have to start the process again, serving the proper notices in the proper order.  Once said notices are properly served and the time for compliance passes without cooperation from the tenant, a Complaint for Summary Dispossess can be filed with the Middlesex County Special Civil Part, Landlord-Tenant Section.  The court will serve the tenant(s) and schedule a trial date, which is usually set within 2 to 3 weeks after service.  If the landlord is granted a judgment for possession, it will at least another 8 days before lock-out can occur.  A warrant for removal can be requested 3 days after judgment is entered and then it takes the court-appointed officers who are the only persons authorized to lock out tenants another 5+ days to actually put out the tenants.  Regarding your ability to access the property to assess damages while the tenants are still in possession, such access must be done upon reasonable notice, which is usually considered to be at lease 24 hours in advance.  If such access is perceived to infringe upon the the tenants' right to the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in every rental lease, you could be in for claim of breach of contract on your part, so be careful not to abuse the access process.  Your father can certainly file a collection action against the tenants for whatever damages they have caused to the property and/or for unpaid rents that exceed what you are holding as security deposit.  It is not always a question of the possibility of winning that is important; the question regarding the possibility of collecting on such a judgment may be more important factor to consider in deciding whether to move forward with such an action.    Most attorneys will charge an hourly fee for such cases, the rates for which vary from attorney to attorney, so you must ask each attorney that you consult for their fees."
1675972,"I'm terribly sorry to hear of your loss.  You raise some good questions and are doing the right thing by asking someone besides the insurance company.  An estate will need to be established, but without a will there is no one who is being directed to represent and administer his estate.  A quality injury attorney can assist you with this.  Also, even though it may appear that the insurance company is being nice and helpful, you may not be getting the full story on applicable coverage.  The claims ""lawyer"" is probably not an attorney at all, just an adjuster.  This adjuster is not ""on your side.""  The at-fault driver could have additional insurance, and you and your family may have additional insurance as well that could apply to this claim.

1824818,"I wish there were a law requiring fairness at work, but there isn't.  Unfortunately, employees and job applicants have very few employment rights, and employers have a lot of leeway in how they choose to run their businesses. In general, an employer can be unfair, obnoxious or bad at management. And an employer can make decisions based on faulty or inaccurate information.  An employer has no obligation to warn an employee that he or she is not performing as the employer wants. It‰Ûªs not a level playing field. An employer hires employees to provide work for its benefit, not for the benefit of the employees. Don't expect the employer to take care of its employees; it doesn‰Ûªt have to and it rarely does.  There are some limitations on what an employer can do, mostly in the areas of public policy (such as discrimination law or whistle blowing), contract law, union-employer labor relations, and constitutional due process for government employees. Please see my guide to at-will employment in California which should help you understand employment rights: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/an-overview-of-at-will-employment-all-states.  After you take a look at the guide, you may be able to identify actions or behavior that fits one of the categories that allows for legal action. If so, an experienced plaintiffs employment attorney may be helpful.  Employment rights come from the state and federal legislatures. One of the best things people can do to improve their employment rights is vote for candidates with a good record on pro-employee, anti-corporate legislation. Another way to protect employment rights is to form or affiliate with a union, or participate in a union already in place.  I hope there is a good resolution to this situation."

I will also point out that if you were working in the US on an immigrant visa, and additional visa charges, tax issues and related matters would arise from this ""accommodation,""  it makes it look even less reasonable.  If your cancer treatment is a treatment not available in the US because it is not recognized as medically viable/necessary/approved by the FDA, then it is wholly unlikely that their failure to accommodate is unreasonable, but speak to an attorney to be sure.

WI passed the ""Monfils"" law to protect individuals who report alleged crimes. As for a defamation case, WI does give immunity to individuals making statements to police officers, so the person may be immune from a defamation suit even if they lie to the officer.

For instance, the Florida Bar, Department of Education, Department of Children and Family services all may have access to your record regardless if you seal it. When you turn 25, the Department of Juvenile Justices has their own internal procedures for expunging the case but I do not think it will ever be 100 percent off your record. You can hire a lawyer to expunge your juvy charge but i would not do it I i was you bc you only get one ""adult"" expungement.  Good luck.

1812668,"The administrator may or may not be overstepping. It depends on what the plan's QDRO Procedures and the Plan provisions say about this type of issue.   To find out whether the plan administrator is overstepping, you need to ask them for a copy of their ""written"" policies and procedures about QDROs and see in there whether they can ask for the divorce decree and whether they can ask for the notarized statement. If they don't have written procedures or policies in place that clearly state they have that authority to demand those documents, then they don't have it and they are overstepping.   Also be careful that their written policies and procedures about QDROs may say that they have discretion to ask for all necessary documents - in that case they would not be overstepping.   Press the plan administrator demanding a copy of their written QDRO Procedures and/or Policy. By law they are required to have something in writing. Then, press them to comply with those procedures (so, they cannot do what the procedures do not allow them to do). If the plan administrator does not have anything in writing, or anything that supports their position that you have to present the notarized statement and the divorce decree, then they would have to accept the advisor's letter.   Some plan administrators would plow over people and overstep the line if you don't stop them. Demanding something in writing that supports their requests is a way to stop them from overstepping the line. By law plan administrators are required to have that in writing, otherwise they cannot make up things on the fly and demand different requirements from different people. The legal requirement to have their procedures in writing serves that purpose, that they treat everybody the same, based on consistent policies.

1802743,"The answer to both questions depends more than anything on the cooperation of the child in question. Without her active assistance in the case, the parents have no chance of success at either objective.   The second question first: Because the child is an adult now, the parents have no right to force their ""help"" on her without her consent. Her parents can certainly reach out to her, offer assistance in material or emotional terms; but whether to accept is her choice. That's what adulthood means.   As for the first question, for the most part, any cause of action against a state agency for this would belong to the child, again, not to the parents. She might have a cause of action against the agency, and certainly against the individual who abused her. Normally such a suit could be barred after a period of time by the statute of limitations, but this statute can be tolled for torts against a minor, until the minor reaches adulthood. So if she did want to make a claim, she'd have to act promptly.   The parents face a serious problem with the statute of limitations (depending on how long ago this happened), and unlike the child, they don't enjoy this tolling of the statute based on the child's age, as they themselves were adults when the abuse occurred. They may have an additional problem based on their previous suit: if it was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" then they are prohibited from filing suit again on the same issue. If it was dismissed ""without prejudice,"" then they are not. A lawyer would have to review the case file to determine which occurred.   But the parents also face an even more serious fundamental problem: without the child's cooperation, proving these allegations would be almost impossible (unless the agent in question were to actually admit to the conduct, which seems very unlikely).   I am sorry to bring such bad news. I have to urge you - that is, the parents - to remember that sometimes children, and abuse victims, want different sorts of resolutions to abuse than their families do. Survivors may well just want to move on, or to not be subjected to others' offers to help, however well-meant. Each survivor has to cope with their experiences in their own way. The best thing families can do is to be available and supportive, but give them the space and freedom they need. Insisting upon taking legal action could be terribly retraumatizing to an abuse victim.  People have this notion that suing someone will be this glorious redemptive process, where their every injury will be avenged and all their feelings validated. This belief is staggeringly wrong. Lawsuits are intensely unpleasant. They force the parties to live through whatever injuries they originally suffered, for months or years. You have to answer tons of difficult questions, over and over again, and if you change your story even a bit, you can be sunk. They rarely go perfectly - the law often produces results that one side or another considers to be unjust, for technical reasons - or just because ""justice"" is a pretty subjective concept. The other side has every motive, and every right, to attack your honesty, your conduct, and your motives. For a victim of abuse, this can be far worse than the original abuse was. I'm not saying these remedies should never be pursued, but these issues should be considered before you embark upon litigation."
1806177,"No it is not too late to seek compensation for your slip and fall incident.  Generally, claims such as yours would be governed by a 4 year statute of limitations.  This means, if you have a legitimate claim, you can seek compensation from 4 years from the date the slip and fall occurred.  I recommend you reach out to another lawyer who may be able to assist you with filing your claim."
1811945,"There have been a number of lawsuits (some class action suits) against national pizza companies (like dominos and pizza hut) claiming wage violations for delivery drivers that pay for their own gas and maintenance.  Most of these have settled out of court.  There has been no national precedent set in these cases, although most attorneys would agree that in situations similar to yours there is indeed a wage/hour violation of some kind happening.  Seek out an attorney to discuss your case in more detail.  Go to www.cela.org to find an attorney in your area."
1807337,"This situation is a real catch 22 for lawyers. We cannot advise clients to break the law, and we also cannot advise them to do things that will get him into trouble.

1825925,"Your friend should waltz into reality.  After a 4th DUI conviction (regardless of when / where the prior convictions occurred) and FL has a mandatory permanent revocation with no hardship reinstatement.  (Don't take my word for it, please see:  http://www.flhsmv.gov/ddl/duilaws.html).  Further, FL participates in the NDR (National Driver Register) and per the language on their website (for your convenience a link will follow as well): The ""NDR is a computerized database of information about drivers who have had their licenses revoked or suspended, or who have been convicted of serious traffic violations such as driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. State motor vehicle agencies provide NDR with the names of individuals who have lost their privileges or who have been convicted of a serious traffic violation.""   When a person applies for a driver's license, the State DMV checks to see if the name is on our NDR database. If a person has been reported to the NDR as a problem driver, the license may be denied.   Please see: http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/National+Driver+Register+(NDR)  Your friend is almost certainly not getting a license and would be well advised NOT to drive m(most especially if he has been drinking).  I hope that this has been helpful in answering your question!"
1789675,"Counselor Monks' answer is right on point.   Understand, you may not be entitled to a copy of each and everything in the attorney's file such as the attorney's personal notes etc. but you are entitled to a copy of all pleadings, correspondence and the originals (such as deeds, abstracts of title, etc.) of anything you have provided to the attorney in handling the probates.  It is imperative for an attorney to maintain his/her own file for a period of at least 5 years before destruction.  Demand an accounting from the attorney to show how your retainers were utilized--his fee must be reasonable.  This time, be sure and hire a lawyer who practices in the probate area."
1802424,"Have you filed your answer?  In your answer,  you need to deny the paternity facts for the child in question.  You should also file a motion for paternity testing. This can be quite complicated. You should consult with a local attorney immediately to protect your rights.  Good luck!"

1797088,"Your HOA should provide a release of line and file it with the land records.  If your HOA fails to do that, then pursuant to the Real Property Article of the Maryland Annotated Code Section 3-105.2, you can hire an attorney prepare Release of Lien Affidavit filed subject to certain conditions and waiting period (i.e. the attorney has to contact the HOA and request a release).  The Release of Lien Affidavit requires proof of payment that the lien is satisfied in full -- you will need copies of cancelled checks, or a recent statement, evidencing you've paid your HOA dues in full."
1821299,"My view is that the Judge had granted an ex-parte order (out of a party's presence). Based on the facts; you are not a direct party to this order and thus you are not bound by it. This is not so much a constitutional issue  restricting your rights in your own home but rather; it is a family law issue involving only your fiance and his ex's place & manner of communication. Your fiance should challenge this order because it was ex-parte (unless he failed to show up at hearing) there was no due process of law, which is violation of his constitutional rights."

1806930,"You will have an interview whether you apply shortly after marriage or if you wait a few years.  Waiting just means that you will not have to later file a petition to lift conditions.  Generally, it is best to file for residence as soon as possible.  I have seen instances where a person on a non-immigrant visa is denied entry or given a hard time when trying to enter the US once the officer finds out that they are married to a US citizen."

1823541,"I think  you should be able to travel without a problem and that nothing will show up after the dismissal unless you apply to be a Police Officer or for a gun permit. Immigration might still see it if you are not a US Citizen. As for whether you can deny having been arrested, lawyers are mixed on this. I am in the camp that believe you cannot deny having been arrested because NY does not expunge."
1784533,"In my opinion this involves Probate Law, not Family Law.  You seem to have a situation in which a trustee (Mom) misappropriated your Trust funds.  Your sister may or may not be innocent in this mess.  Mom may be mentally incompetent and thus unable to sign any legal document, but there may already be an adequate paper trail protecting your rights between Mom and Sister."
1822020,Usually it takes about three weeks to get your card after USCIS approves your case.
1824477,Perhaps the reason you are unable to get a good answer is because you posted this as a criminal defense question. It is not a criminal defense question and those of us who specialize in defending criminal charges know little about social security. I am re-tagging this question social security so you will get lawyers who deal with that.
1802728,There are numerous ways to do this depending on (1) whether I-94 is expired? (2) Whether you wish to port or consular process? etc.  Consult with an attorney to understand the options you have and accordingly decide how you wish to proceed.
1941282,"Sir, I'm glad to hear you are off the streets and getting things back together in your life.  I have practiced in North San Diego County for 19 years and have an office in Vista near the courthouse.  You need to retain an attorney to help you clear these warrants.  Without a detailed consultation (free) it is difficult to speculate on ""what you are facing"" with all these warrants, but I can assure you that the sooner you handle them the better.  If you cannot afford a private attorney, contact the Public Defender's Office in Vista for assistance.  Best wishes."
1167125,"Most decisions are made within 2-6 weeks after a NOID is issued. The majority of NOIDs end in denial, even if you provide the right evidence however. Unfortunately, unless you have an underlying immigration status, you will fall out of status when you file you appeal of their denial. Unlike a NOID response, an appeal can easily take 1 year to process.   If you receive a denial it's time to admit that doing this yourself is not going to work and it's time to hire a professional. Most immigration lawyers will provide a free consultation to you to explain what you did wrong and how they can help. Hopefully your case will still be approved, but if not you may find yourself in a very bad place where you would need to pay more to correct it than if you just hired a lawyer to do your case right in the first place.  Good luck."
1828576,"First, if I were representing you, I'd have phoned the DAs office before today and learned the status and, of course, called you off from appearing.  The DAs office would have replied either 1) We have nothing on this case (meaning cops have yet to deliver it to them);  2) we've rejected the case for filing (there will be no case because of insufficient evidence) or 3) the case has been referred to the City Atty for misdemeanor filing.    There is no need to appear if no case is on calendar for the judge to call.  Second, the turnaround time from your recent arrest date until today is relatively quick for a felony.  I'd normally expect them to take more time, especially on a narco case where lab results may be pending.    If a filing occurs down the line, a letter will be sent.  No need to write CYA letters to the cops or DA that may cause them to locate a misplaced file.    Last---if the DA eventually files a case before the statute of limitations runs, there still may be a valid motion to dismiss for a due process violation if you can show that the delay in filing somehow prejudiced your ability to defend yourself.  Discuss these points, as well as your bail issue, with your lawyer."
1806682,"There is a process called supplemental proceedings that provides for this. Basically there is a petition filed in Circuit Court (and in Lexington it is referred to the Master in Equity). The Court issues an order that the debtor appear for a hearing so that they can be questioned, under oath, about their accounts and property. There are also provisions available to send subpoenas to third parties. Ultimately if you can locate suitable assets you can get a court order that they be used to satisfy the judgment."
1801629,Opinions are just that.  Opinions.  But any opinion based on the few sentences written will not be as good as the attorney who is fully informed of all the facts of your case including the extent and history of your addiction and has been speaking to the ADA assigned to your case. In my opinion it's possible but there aren't enough facts to give more of an opinion.
1785430,"I think that I understand your question. Your name is still on the title to the property, thus, you still have liability issues if someone is hurt, etc. on the property. You want to relinquish title to the lender and want to know the best route to do this. If the property is currently the subject of a foreclosure action you (or your foreclosure defense counsel) can contact the bank and agree to a CONSENT JUDGMENT. That is where you basically agree that you have no defenses to the foreclosure action and you are informing the court that you agree to allow the Plaintiff lender to proceed with the foreclosure as you will not be raising any defenses. This allows the Plaintiff lender to ask the Court to shorten the time frame in which a foreclosure sale date will be issued. You are also correct that you can request that the lender agree to a deed-in-lieu (""DIL"") but I find that lenders are not well equipped to proceed with a DIL. Remember, they don't want your property, they want money. Therefore, your best bet, where you will have the most control over the process, is to list the property for a short sale and submit a short sale application to your lender. Even though you don't need to do the short sale (because you don't need the deficiency waived) it will allow you to speed up the process of getting the title to the property out of your name. I hope that I have answered your question. Good luck with whichever route you take."
1884650,"Thanks for your question.  Unfortunately, at this juncture, you need to hire an attorney well versed in construction litigation.  Your options are two fold: demand that the contractor fix the pool at no cost to you, or hire a new contractor to fix the pool and sue the prior contractor for the difference.  I would imagine off the bat you want to avoid litigation, as that raises your out-of-pocket costs significantly, but that of course depends entirely on the contractor's response to a demand letter.  It is also important that we review your contract in order to comply with the notice and termination provisions.   Good luck."

1805086,"California Civil Code Section 1954 provides that a landlord may enter a dwelling unit to show it to prospective buyers, but the landlord must provide specific notice to the tenant beforehand.  The notice must include the purpose of the entry and the date and approximate time of the planned entry, which must be during normal business hours, unless the tenant consents otherwise.  You should give the tenant WRITTEN notice of those three things at least 24 hours before you plan to enter.  If you choose to mail the notice (rather than hand-deliver it), you must mail the notice at least 6 days before you plan to enter the unit.  Now, here is the key:  Once you give WRITTEN notice to the tenant that you will be ""showing the unit to prospective or actual buyers"", then you are free to give 24 hours VERBAL notice to the tenant for the 120 day period following the written notice.  If your lease agreement provides that you will not enter the unit without her being present, you should add something to your written notice stating that you have offered to schedule the showing on X number of occasions to accommodate her schedule, but she has refused to allow you to enter on each and every one, then ask her to please be reasonable.  You need to establish and keep a record proving that you tried in good faith to comply with the lease provision in case she brings a claim against you for violating it."
1796539,Mr. Dane's answer is spot on. Only the prosecutor can charge you with a crime. This is most likely a misdemeanor. You need to learn your fourth fifth and sixth amendment rights. You were your own worst enemy under these circumstances. They now have an admission that can be used against you. I believe you should hire local criminal defense counsel or at the very least have a free public defender appointed before you consider any offers the court and DA offer. Take no deals until and unless you have spoken to counsel first. Good luck. Hope this helps?
1798638,"Pursuant to a parenting plan and Final Judgment a parent cannot relocate more than 50 miles from the child's home at the time of entry of the Final Judgement.

If for some reason they have been enrolled in your school district and this school is better (better rating) than the one Mom intends to move the children to, you may have grounds to request a modification to the parenting plan.

1799191,"Interesting question.  Landlords are often turning off utilities as a means of self-help.  When they involve heat, light and similar matters, this is considered a constructive eviction and can result in damages -- eventually, not immediately.  TV and internet may not be considered necessities.  I doubt if there is any case law involving TV and internet shut off.  However, you may be able to make a case that internet is a necessity, since you are using it for job hunting.  Internet is definitely a necessity for me, but TV is not.  As a practical matter, you are going to have to make a deal.  If you have someplace to move, perhaps you can agree to move out sooner than you might do otherwise in exchange for a turn-on of the internet.  Or perhaps you can go to the library to use the computer. You must be doing something in this regard, since you reached me by internet.  CLT"
1806783,"There's no real limit on what you can change your name to (no numbers, no racial slurs, no changes for purposes of fraud, so don't change it to ""Brad Pitt"", or ""Bill Clinton"" that's about it...) and the only reason you need is ""I want to"".   The biggest cost, if you get the filing fee waived, is the publication fee; you're required to have the notice of the petition published in a newspaper, and since they're NOT part of the court, THEY won't give you a fee waiver.

1797202,"The answer to your question is simple.  In Florida, ""initiation of litigation,"" unless specifically defined in your contract, refers to the actual filing of the initial pleading, which is generally a complaint or petition.

1827706,This is potentially a complicated case. You should consult with an immigration attorney who has experience with criminal law. You are right that persons who have engaged in  prostitution within the past ten years are inadmissible to the U.S.  A conviction of a prostitution offense is also a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) and may trigger inadmissibility on that ground. You may be eligible for a waiver if you can prove hardship to your U.S. citizen spouse. Be sure to bring all your documents related to your conviction to any consultation with an immigration attorney so they can determine if you are eligible for any immigration benefit.
1802857,"Since you stated  that your US LPR spouse is getting her condition removed by virtue of I-751, ONLY her criminal history is relevant NOT YOURS, as you are a USC, therefore your current DUI case has no bearing on your spouse's criminal history who has nothing on her record according to you."

You might be deemed to be in ""possession"" of the marijuana your passenger has if you know of it and since it's your car, could ""control"" it.  You do not have a card, so this could be considered unlawful possession.  Even with a card, it is illegal to drive while under the influence of marijuana--so beware the second-hand effects.

A lot of counties have a family court facilitator that can help with the documents or you can get the do-it-yourself pleadings online.  However, since this involves custody you should help your stepdaughter hire an attorney on her behalf so that all the protections are in place for her and her child in the event things are not always agreeable between them.  in many instances, the parents ideas of what is appropriate may not be protecting themselves or the child over the long term."
1789993,"Without knowing the specific facts of your case, I cannot say for certain.  You should have a candid discussion with your attorney about the statute and rules governing consecutive sentencing, meaning the imposition of one sentence after the other. Section 40-35-115 provides that the court may order sentences to run consecutively if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) The defendant is a professional criminal who has knowingly devoted the defendant's life to criminal acts as a major source of livelihood; (2) The defendant is an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive; (3) The defendant is a dangerous mentally abnormal person so declared by a competent psychiatrist who concludes as a result of an investigation prior to sentencing that the defendant's criminal conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive or compulsive behavior with heedless indifference to consequences. (4) The defendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little or no regard for human life and no hesitation about committing a crime in which the risk to human life is high; (5) The defendant is convicted of two (2) or more statutory offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor with consideration of the aggravating circumstances arising from the relationship between the defendant and victim or victims, the time span of defendant's undetected sexual activity, the nature and scope of the sexual acts and the extent of the residual, physical and mental damage to the victim or victims; (6) The defendant is sentenced for an offense committed while on probation; o (7) The defendant is sentenced for criminal contempt. Rule 32 (c) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: (c) Concurrent or Consecutive Sentences. (1) Multiple Sentences from One Trial. If the defendant pleads guilty or is convicted in one trial of more than one offense, the trial judge shall determine whether the sentences will be served concurrently or consecutively. The order shall specify the reasons for this decision and is reviewable on appeal. Unless it affirmatively appears that the sentences are consecutive, they are deemed to be concurrent.  You need to consult with your attorney about this statute and rule to see if you are subject to consecutive sentences.  If so, you could receive a sentence of more than two years."
1822026,"Significant changes of circumstances may enable a former spouse to ask the court to increase or decrease alimony, or terminate alimony.

1800338,"Based on what you're saying, I'm thinking you're not asking about what amount of the debt should be assigned to each person, but how exactly the debt itself will be handled.  The first thing you should know is that you and your wife can't change the agreement with the creditor without including them. Whatever that agreement is will stay in place because it's wouldn't be fair for person C to have their rights and obligations changed by person A and B without person C's knowledge.  That means whatever happens with the debt, it will remain between you and your wife (unless one or the other co-signed the other's student loan).  In terms of how to write the actual language to create the split--this is what an attorney is for.  We can't tell you what to write down to make sure your agreement is binding and effective, it's against the rules of ethical conduct and Avvo's ToS."
1819627,"In California? Good luck.   Most people refer to an ""expungement"".  California does not have a true ""expungement"" statute. What we do have is a dismissal under Penal Code 1203.4.

That allows you to tell most employers that you have not been convicted of the crime, but it remains on your record and still counts as a prior conviction.   You cannot seal adult records unless you are NOT convicted and you are found to be factually innocent."

Is there some sort of court order giving him visitation or parenting time?  This information would be helpful. The best advice that can be given with this small amount of information is, don't violate a court order.  And contact an attorney to discuss your situation."
2234752,It will likely be a pretty manageable case but you will want to hire an attorney to minimize any collatetal damage if not preserve your clean record entirely.
1824208,There is not enough information to give you an accurate answer. These matters are fact specific and a detailed analysis would be necessary. Based on what was posted it wouldn't seem to hurt your situation. Just make sure to follow the order completely going forward.

1795437,"I agree with Mr. Hoffman and state further:  As a family and divorce lawyer for the past 29 years, I have never come across any instance of a small claims action for breach of promise based upon a broken engagement.  If you have large monetary losses and can prove they were caused by your former fiance, then go ahead and file, but do not rely on a breach of promise theory, and do not even count on prevailing.  Better, yet, let it go.  Either way, if you sue in Illinois, you will probably be bound by Illinois law."
1809147,You need to get a personal injury attorney licensed in Connecticut right away.  There are many laws regarding service of process and also how to deal with injuries if the at fault driver is uninsured.  Most personal injury attorneys take cases on a contingency basis so you wouldn't need to pay any money up front.  This is the best way to make sure you are protected!
1824904,"You need an attorney to handle this for you.  Your Insurance will only defend you against claims made by others. If you're claiming other party was at fault and owes you money for property damage and personal injury, you must go after opposing insurance. It is best to use an attorney"
1810106,"This is a very serious situation. Your sister could be charged with a variety of felony level offenses. The obvious ones are enumerated under W.S. 35-7-1031. Lortab's active ingredient, Hydrocodone, is a Schedule II drug, which can carry a 20 year sentence. Since the alleged facilitation of the meds resulted in death, however, the prosecutors in Laramie County may have the ability to add additional felony charges. Your sister needs to hire an attorney ASAP, to protect her rights, even if she is not currently charged. Our firm handles criminal matters, and would be willing to offer a free consultation, if you think our services could be of help. Hope this helps!"
1793253,"I suggest you meet with a local family law/child custody lawyer asap.  Many lawyers offer free initial consultations and can explain your options and likelihood of winning a motion to compel your ex to pay for extracurricular activities, take him to Saturday activities, etc.  You have nothing to lose by meeting with a lawyer.  It's possible you and your husband would benefit from attending mediation to try to resolve your differences.  Only a local lawyer who is familiar with the facts of your divorce, the issues, and your and your ex's financial situation can properly advise you regarding the best, easiest, most peaceful and/or most economical options for resolving these issues.  Once you know what you might be legally entitled to if you pursued legal intervention, it might help you put the issues between you into perspective.  Even if you could ""force"" your ex to take your son to his Saturday activities, you should consider if that would be in your child's best interests if his father is complaining to him or not enthusiastic as he is dragging him to his Saturday activities.  Depending on the age of your son and motivation for attending the activity, it could turn off your son to the activity.  Bottom line is that you should meet with a lawyer to find out all of your options and the likelihood of a judge granting a motion if you filed it, and weigh the costs and advantages and disadvantages of doing so.  Good luck."
1795887,"Does your husband have a chance of having it dropped?  Sure, he does, but it may be tough, especially since you are married and he presumably knew about it and he was driving.  Time to hire a very good local defense attorney."
1813629,"If you have filed suit against the US Government, the government gets an extended period of time to respond, and, you have to make sure your summons is served on the correct person and agency.  Assuming your summons gave the government the requisite time period to respond (which is more than 25 days), and served it properly, then you file a motion for clerk's default.  A clerk will enter your default for you once you file the proper form.  However, if you did not properly serve the lawsuit, the default may be set aside.  You may or may not get a full win. But once the default is entered you must file a motion for final default judgment. And file a proposed judgment.  The judge will review the file and make sure that it was properly served and the time to respond was afforded to the defendant agency. If the judge is satisfied with the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, you get your final default judgment. If not, you may be ordered to amend or re-serve the complaint."
1807126,"Make sure to immediately file the I-751, with the help of an experienced immigration lawyer if possible. USCIS will accept late fling of the I-751, as long as had a good cause for filing late. Having traveled back home to be at the bed site of an ailing parent who later passed away is a good one.  The only thing where they may want to get you is the length of time - two months does not seem reasonable, unless you can convincingly argue that it was, considering..  Best to also supplement I-751 with a psychological report of wife's depression and state of mind after mother's death.  Make sure to only use a professional licensed as a ""clinical psychologist"".  This type of report, if properly prepared by a qualified professional will have the force and effect of ""expert testimony"" and cannot be (successfully) challenged or questioned by USCIS. I my office I routinely order such a report in similar circumstances."
1828102,"Yes, your son has potential liability for distributing ""kiddie porn"" even though the pictures were of himself.  Before you enter the legal arena, you should consult with a lawyer to discourage unintended consequences.  The man from the Phillipines is definately engageing in blackmail and if he were in the U.S., your local police would be the place to seek help.  However, since the man is overseas, your problems are far more complicated.    You may want to discuss your situation with a lawyer in more detail. Most lawyers on Avvo offer a free phone consultation."
2132682,You should talk to a local lawyer who specializes in employment cases. I will reclassify your question so those who do that kind of work are more likely to see it. Good luck
1807155,"It is based on net, not gross.  However, case law makes it clear that judges should be cautious when allowing self employed people to deduct necessary and reasonable business expenses from their financial affidavits in order to reduce their child support.  Judges know that business orders purposely play game with their books.  A good lawyer can help a person show that the self employed business owner is actually earning more than they claim."
1816259,"You employer is generally free to include in your file any items the employer considers important. If the gist of your question is ""my employer seems to be trying to build a case for firing me"", your instincts are probably correct. If you think that the employer is mis-stating or exaggerating the facts, you should start building documentation of your own.  You may find helpful my legal guide ""When you see the handwriting on the wall, start writing it down on paper"".  I've included a link to that below."
1805827,You are not legally obligated to comply with their investigation.  A typical investigation should only take 60-60 days - if it's lasting longer than that there should be some particular need stated.  If you're compliant with medical & treatment there should be any concern they have.  Write a letter to them asking that the case be closed & you receive a determination letter which either indicates or unfounds the case against you.  Call a Family Law attorney in your area for a full assessment.
1734156,"Theoretically you can go to court without an attorney, but these are not simple areas of law. No government agency I know of will intervene. You need to decide whether the minority interests are or are not worth attorney fees. With an attorney you would go to court, seek to compel a meeting and an a accounting and perhaps damages for matters such as breach of fiduciary duty, etc."
1799907,"You have at least 30 days between the expected delivery date until your status runs out. If by then you and doc think that this time plus the 30 days grace period is not enough and you are not subject to 2 years foreign residency requirement which should be stated on your visa, then you could apply for a change of status to tourist until baby can fly but your I-539 must be received by the CIS before 12/12/2014."
1818865,"You need a lawyer to defend the charges.  Many counties have a diversion program where you take a class and do community service and then the charges are dropped.  An attorney will know whether a diversion program is available.  A conviction will affect your employment prospects for the rest of your life.  On the other hand, if the charges are dropped, you can get your record expunged.  Do not post any more details on AVVO since this is a public forum and anything you post can be used against you.  If you cannot afford private counsel, contact the Public Defender as soon as possible and no later than 10 business days before the court date."
1792694,They do not have to join them in the action. They can foreclose on the home and own it with your mortgage still on the property - they don't have to pay it off. They can then sell the home (typically for the amount they are owed in HOA dues) and then the buyer will own it subject to your mortgage also.  The end game is to rent it out and generate rental income before the bank comes knocking again against the HOA or subsequent owner.
1809509,"YOU need to see a family law attorney.  It sounds like a modification may be in order.  One real problem, is that this girl is getting to elect where she is going to live.  That gives her far too much control over her life.  She needs a stable custody arrangement."
1812339,It normally takes 2-3 months to be scheduled for an interview from that point on.
1812745,"Michigan law does not allow child support to be modified retroactively; that is, support can only be modified for the future, not for payments that have already become due. Once child support is ordered or billed to your account, it is due and payable and usually cannot be changed. You should call an attorney to discuss your situation further and explore your legal options."
1810873,"The type of sanctions you speak of are only ""automatic"" if the payment is set up to go through probation. If your agreement is that he is to pay you directly then you will need to file a motion for enforcement  but he will need to be served so the motion should be filed immediately upon his return. In that  motion you can seek payment through probation, loss of license, passport, etc."
1825317,"If there is a contract giving you a 120 grace period you are still late even when partial payment is accepted.  If there is no contractual grace period you were late when you were 1 day past due.  It is always best to stay in close contact with creditors, once the debt does go to collections it is nearly impossible to remove in from collections prior to satisfying the total amount due.  At times creditors appreciate partial payments but unless they know your intent they may consider it as intentionally shirking the true amount due and send immediately to collections so contact them soon. Best of luck."
1808317,"VAWA petition takes up to a year to be adjudicated at VSC. Your police or hospital records may be useful to support the claim of abuse, but are not essential. Wait for Request for Evidence from USCIS that may arrive at a later date, to see which additional documents may be requested, if any."
1821412,"This question requires further facts than you have provided to give you a better picture of your legal rights.  Many states have statutes similar to the one in Washington State regarding whether an inventor is under an obligation to assign IP or not.  If your new employer is NOT located in WA state or a state that has a such a statute, some of your legal rights might change.  For example, CA has such a statute, Cal. Labor Code Section 2870.  Most employers do not want to rely on these types of statutes alone so they ask all employees to sign agreements assigning IP to the company AND they ask R&D professionals, engineers,and other professionals working in technology development, such as software development, to sign more extensive agreements related to ""Inventions and Other Intellectual Property"".  Your new employer will likely require you to sign such a document.  It is critical that your new inventions be listed as exceptions to this agreement, including the new development work that has not even taken place yet.  Your new employer may or may not be supportive of this development, especially if this work is even remotely related to their business.  These are serious issues that could potentially affect whether you should even take this new job.  You should contact an intellectual property attorney, preferably one comfortable with these types of cross-over employment law issues in the state where you will be living and working with the new employer.  You should do this BEFORE you accept this new position and definitely BEFORE you sign any inventions agreement with the new employer.  Good luck!"
1815843,"This arrest alone should not affect your citizenship application.  Since it was so long ago, the absence of any subsequent arrests will certainly act in your favor.  There could be other reasons to deny your citizenship application, but generally remote minor crimes are not a reason.  There is also some recent case law saying that possession of less that 30 grams of marijuana for personal use does not carry the harsh immigration consequences that other drug charges do."

1791001,There is no statute of limitations on disclosure (although there is a Texas statute that guides Texas companies and prohibits reporting cases that are more than 7 years old.)  You should talk to a lawyer to see if you can petition for nondisclosure (sealing the record) and then you know they will no find the cases.
1875990,"Your choice - you either continue to wait - ""until the cows come home"" (they never do.. that's why they place bells around their necks - to know where they are at all times..) OR you hire a reputable and knowledgeable immigration lawyer (not a cheap, new or fly by nighter) to file a Mandamus Action in federal court on your behalf, to compel USCIS to finally act on your case.   But you only do that if you have a ""squeaky clean"" case!  If you don't, don't even think about it - you'll get burned to the 3rd degree.. It won't be cheap.. With the money you'll spend on the case you could very well put a down payment on a decent apartment in the Bronx or even Spanish Harlem.. Your choice."
1816850,"It depends on your lease. The other answers are correct.  If it is a single family home, you are renting the house and the property (in almost all cases).  If you are renting an apartment, you are only renting the physical unit and not the land outside.  If it is a single home converted into a duplex, it would depend on your lease and how you've used the property.  Do you maintain the yard? Do you garden in it or have outdoor furniture of your own?  Or is the land shared with the other unit and the landlord takes care of it?"
1789522,"In nearly all cases the insurance company is entitled to fees incurred in filing an interpleader action. Once the defendants are joined, the insurance company is a stakeholder at most. The carrier can avoid even that by paying the net proceeds into court. The carrier‰Ûªs attorneys never acted as your attorney. They merely filed the lawsuit so the court could decide among competing claims. The carrier should file a motion to recover its costs. You can opposed the motion if filed. Good luck."
1795236,"It is not illegal to date.  In PA the Age of consent is 16 with a 4 year differential for those above the minimum age (14) but below the age of consent.  ie.  The older person can not be more than 4 years older than the minor.  For example if you were 15 then the boyfriend could not be more than 19 to be able to legally consent to sexual intercourse.  Since you were the age of consent at the time your were ""dating"", I don't believe that you have anything to be concerned legally about."
1816542,"One way to handle this would be file an RFO to bifurcate status only. This way you may be able to get your divorce out of the way first. Then, if she chooses to continue to take you to court over support issues, you can litigate that separately. Another thing you may want to consider is asking the court to impute income to her since it appears she is consistently receiving help and support from her parents."
1793348,GA is a single-party consent state when it comes to recording.
1866949,This threat of jail to collect a debt is a clear FDPCA violation.  Do you have any  recordings or written documents of the threat?  do you know the exact time of day the call was made?  Usually the conversations are recorded.  Check your caller ID for that information if you have it.  If you can prove this consult with an attorney that does FDPCA cases and Bankruptcy.  I don't know how big your financial burden is to advise of bankruptcy.  You would know that best.
1800528,"I would just pay it. It is way cheaper and easier than looking for a new place to live. You WERE late making the payment. There is no obligation for the landlord to accept anything other than timely payments. I understand your agreement with the manager. If the manager had written down the agreement, it might have been enforceable, although the landlord could have argued that the manager had no authority to make that agreement.   James Frederick"
1891316,You ost likely be cited for retail theft if the value of what was allegedly taken.  A fine will be imposed upon a plea of guilty or a finding of guilt. Speak with a locsl attorney to see if there is any way to avoid a conviction.
2086960,"I suggest that you contact an attorney who is skilled in preparing these documents.  A Will is different from a Living Will.  One divides up your property after your death and one specifies your medical preferences in the event that you are in an end-stage medical condition or state of permanent unconsciousness.  In our office, we believe that the most basic estate plan should include no less than a Will, a Durable Power of Attorney for property and finance, a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (which has a Living Will in it) and a HIPAA Release.  With these documents, you should be able to specify your wishes and identify your surrogates in the event of incapacity or death.  Good luck."

1793719,"Your friend needs to discuss his situation with a criminal defense lawyer who is familiar with both federal appeals and other federal post conviction remedies and with a criminal defense lawyer who practices Texas criminal defense. This may well be the same man or woman, but not necessarily. A good place to start in trying to find the lawyer or lawyers is with whomever is currently representing your friend on his state charges.   Time is of the essence!  DEADLINES apply. ACTION NEEDED TODAY!"
1799549,"Sorry, Babu! That scheme will not work. First of all, having been ""selected"" is not the same as the employer having had its H-1B ""approved.""  Even if ""A"";s petition on your behalf has been approved, the H-1B status will only kick in come October 1.  Thus, even if your ""stamping"" will be successful at the local US consulate, the earliest you can be admitted on H-1B status will be September 20th.  Until you actually start working for the petitioning employer through whom you got H-1B status and visa ""stamp"" you cannot seek to ""transfer"". You will only be able to jump ship and ""transfer' once you ""activated"" your new status by having actually started working for the petitioning employer. Not before and not unless."
1822747,"The state has immunity and you can't sue for a speedy trial violation.  There is the rare case where you may be able to sue for malicious prosecution, but those are almost impossible to win. You can sue the person that falsely accused you and in some cases the police. Once your case is dismissed you need to discuss any possible law suits with a civil rights or personal injury attorney."
1805132,"From your information, it appears that you have learned of this happening and are asking what additional steps you can take to assist the State in protecting your son and others from being the victim of theft or other crimes. Assuming this is correct, make certain that your name and contact information is part of the file being sent to the prosecutor, and then once the file has been sent to the prosecutor contact the victim/witness unit of that prosecuting authority to make sure they are aware that  you as the guardian want to be advised as to what is occurring, and your willingness to speak out on behalf of your son."
1813775,"Don't waste your time and money with a K-3. There are no advantages to it. It is simply an non-immigrant visa which will later necessitate the filing of an I-130 petition (unlike the K-1 fiancee visa.) The CR-1 is the ""conditional"" permanent residence status for when the marriage is less than 2 years old when the green card application is filed."
1812158,An immigration lawyer might have this knowledge but I doubt anyone keeps a master list.
1795858,"It doesn't seem like such a restriction would be warranted, but it always depends on the terms of  the person's probation, so the probationer  may want to review these terms to see if they can see what term the cohabitation would violate. After doing that I think the probationer should ask the PO why this is prohibited. Once the probationer has all this information he or she may want to consider hiring counsel to help them seek a modification of their probation  or even seek to terminate the probation."
1809565,"No, you don't have to pay before your appointment. You may have a probable cause argument. Really though, the hearing officer will likely give you a pretty good deal. If you can avoid being convicted and pay a reduced fine, you'd be doing pretty good. If not, then ask for a court date and get a lawyer."
1799330,No. This is not possible unless you used your First Offender for drugs (conditional discharge) which is different from a regular First Offender.
1814289,"It's impossible to answer questions like this in any meaningful way without reviewing the case.  Yes, it MIGHT be possible.  You really need to have a detailed consultation with an experienced immigration attorney for a more precise and accurate answer."
1808553,"If the provisional agreement was an order, absent fraud, or some other reason, he will not be able to get out of what was already paid. He could, however, request modification of the current provisional order if he is not able to sustain it, or if it has become impractical for some reason.  Although there are a lot of details that are unknown here, it does seem as though you may qualify for spousal maintenance, based upon the information provided."
1818200,"It seems as if several aspects of your question went unanswered..  The designation ""fugitive of justice"" sometimes accompanies the issuance of a felony warrant when the police have searched for someone in state and cannot locate them . The term is not a criminal charge and is actually pretty meaningless.   There are no additional sanctions if a person is designated a fugitive.  At a bail hearing it can be established that the person did not ""flee"" at all.   As to the second part of your question.  If a person is arrested on a felony fugitive warrant in a state that did not issue the warrant - they will be brought in custody to the appropriate local judge to be advised of the warrant - and at that point a lengthy and complex extradition procedure kicks in for a formal return to the warrant issuing state.  I am including an article that explains the process.. I hope this helps."
1828882,"The ""ramifications"" for that employer will be the fact that unless that employer ""withdraws"" both the LCA and I-129/H by notifying each DOL and USCIS respectively, that employer will remain liable for the proffered wage promised on the LCA for the duration of the terminated employee's H-1B validity period."
1802123,"In addition to Mr. Eisenberg's helpful comments, let me add that your father will want to make the effort to consult with experienced elder law counsel.  Transfers of real property have substantial (and typically very unwelcome) consequences for future MediCal eligibility.  Adept elder law counsel can assist in structuring any transfer and in other estate planning strategies that will not forfeit future rights to needed public benefits.  I have recategorized as ""elder law"" because real property transfer procedure is the easy part.  The hard part is finding a strategy that serves your father's objectives and best interests.    Best wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."
1830009,"Typically witnesses to crimes who meet with an Assistant State Attorney do not need their own representation.  If there is some reason, however, that you are concerned about your role in the offense, you should consult with an attorney before the meeting."
1826412,"You can file your divorce pro se in the county where you reside. You cannot file for a joint simplified divorce. Your income has no bearing on whether you filed pro se. However, you are at a distinct disadvantage if you do not hire counsel to assist you or at least to give you guidance on how to proceed."
1789679,I am sorry to hear about your daughter not getting proper care.... You should consult local attorneys who have experience in nursing home neglect cases....  I suggest that you take the pictures of your daughter's bedsores and show it the attorneys you contact about the case....
1795386,"One basis to get your marriage annulled is ""want of understanding"", which can cover a lot of area, especially in an agreed upon annulment.  I would avoid any claim of material misrepresentations (which could be viewed by outsiders as ""fraud"").  However, if you two agree an annulment is appropriate, there are ways to carefully craft a Complaint for Annulment where no fraud need obviously be pled."
1808393,"I agree with attorney Smith.  I do want to add that you should discuss the benefits of a Transfer on Death Deed with your CPA & attorney.  I suggest this because receiving the house as an inheritance placing your name on the deed will allow you to receive the tax benefits of the basis of the house being ""stepped-up"" at the time of your father's death.  However, if it is likely that your father will have creditors at the time of his death, it might be better to have your name on the deed and pay any taxes due when you sell the home.  Bottom line, just make sure that you are aware of the benefits and disadvantages of each option.  Hope this helps!"
1795801,"Legal ethics has to do with the way lawyers treat their clients, and the way they interact with the court and their adversaries. It has nothing to do with the way they treat their employees. Reading between the lines it seems that the law firm you are working for may handle very large numbers of claims, perhaps mass tort or disability claims of some sort. Such firms work more like call centers than places where clients receive individual attention. Your employers may not treat their clients any better than they treat their employees, but that is just speculation on my part.  You can look for another job if this one is stressing you out too much. It's a free country in that regard."
1809219,"You can still make a claim but you need medical support for your claim.  ""Witness statements"" cannot confirm your injury.  Only a doctor can do that.  Witness testimony/ statements are great.  Witnesses--i.e. friends or relatives that can testify as to how an injury affects you is very powerful.  However, again, without medical support no one will ever get to consider that evidence. I agree with those who responded that waiting months before getting treatment makes the claim more difficult.  Certainly I understand why you have not received treatment.  The ""other side"" however will argue this means you are not hurt. You cannot handle this on your own.  GEt a lawyer and get some treatment--IMMEDIATELY."
1784725,"The attorney represents the agency and the agency retains settlement authority.  This is parallel to all attorney - client relationships; decisions to settle are the right and responsibility of the client (the agency in your question).  An attorney can and should present his or her client with the options for resolution and the consequences of not settling.  The attorney can and should make recommendations.  But the decision lies with the agency, always.  Some agencies or some personnel within agencies will listen to the recommendation of the attorney and others will blow off the recommendation.  I've represented many clients against federal agency employers and have found that most agencies welcome the advice of their attorneys but still make their own decisions.  It varies greatly how much they weigh the legal advice they receive."
1791809,"You really would have to know what the specific rules are for his agency, perhaps the union rep could help.  Depending on his agency, many departments have their own code of ethics with more specific rules. Police officers generally are expected to maintain high standards of ethics in both their public and private lives, so it could be an issue if he lives with or dates someone who is violating the law, but you would really have to check those rules for his department.  As an aside, and as advice for the future when writing anywhere where you need a professional thoughtful and intelligent response, we attorneys volunteer our time to give advice to people on AVVO in order to help.  If this question is important to you (and it obviously is) and you respect and appreciate the free guidance (and you probably do and should) is it too much trouble to actually take the effort to spell out the fifteen to twenty words in your question?  Its just a bit disrespectful/ungrateful to me."
1707098,"Your question is pretty involved. It may be prudent to get a CFI (Child and Family Investigator) involved in this case so that a proper report can be submitted to the court. Generally speaking, however, å¤14-10-124(1.5)(a)(II) states that the court shall consider ""the wishes of the child if he or she is sufficiently mature to express reasoned and independent preferences as to the parenting time schedule"".   You will notice that a specific age is not enumerated in the statute for purposes of your question, however, we usually see a court giving weight to a child's preference at the age of 16 and 12 -- the 8 year old is a little harder, but the court may still give weight to his preference as well. It is advisable to look into a CFI so that person can interview your children and express their feelings re: parenting time in his/ her report and thus, you would avoid hearsay objections and other issues that may arise.   You can also consider filing a motion for the Judge to interview the children, but this is completely up to the Judge and most Judges do not grant these motions."
2003656,If there is that much equity in the house it is well worth the money to get an attorney involved to ensure you get what is owed to you. Unless he can refinance in his own name there is no way to escape your financial responsibility to the bank. Even if you sign a quitclaim deed the bank will sue you if bills aren't paid. It is also important to determine what your settlement agreement or JOD says about the issue of the marital home as its terms will control.
1822363,"I agree with my colleagues here. Just want to add that if you do not know of any Social Security attorneys in your area, this website has a great ""Find a Lawyer"" tool to help you find one. Most attorneys in this area offer free consultations. Best of luck to you."
1794587,"If a person admits to a probation officer that he has violated the terms and conditions of his probation, that is enough for a probation violation to be filed. You should consult an attorney immediately. And be careful what you say to your PO!"

1793907,"I am sorry for your loss.  In order to answer your question, I am going to guess you are trying to figure out who will take any equity in the property in the absence of a will.  In California, in the absence of a will property passes through a process called intestate succession. This depends on factors you haven't resolved in your question - so I can't give you a firm answer.  However, typically, this succession goes first to the spouse (either in whole or in part depending on certain factors), then to the surviving children in equal shares.  The rules are a bit different if the mother's spouse pre-deceased her, the former spouse died within 15 years of her, they owned the property together, and her children were not his children.    Brother in law isn't a class of persons who takes by intestate succession - but if he is married to your husband's sister, she may be entitled to a share.    So, with this in mind, you should probably meet with an attorney to address your rights based on all of the information available.  I hope this answers your question."

The fact that discovery is closed means that neither party may ask for more discovery or take depositions, but this cutoff date can be waived if both sides agree or if the court orders it waived or more discovery.  The court could also continue the trial and order discovery reopened.

At your age (and any age for that matter), losing the consort of your spouse for that significant amount of time can be quite devastating and destabilizing.  I hope you are both doing much better now.  Yes, proving Loss of Consortium can be quite a challenge as it is an abstract thing for the most part, but generally, you want to show the defendants how badly the injury affected the quality of your life together.  This may include showing them 'before and after' pictures, videos, events, even testimonials from friends and other documentary evidence of what you both did together before the injury, that you couldn't do while spouse was hurt and perhaps still can't do today.  Don't let the adjuster pigeon-hole you into what they consider to be loss of consortium.  It is a lot broader than sex or intimate moments alone.  The documentary and testamentary evidence can be considerable in quantity, considering your ages and time together.  A lifetime actually.  I know you have considered seeking legal help which is why you posted this question on AVVO, but maybe you should also consider a face-to-face free consultation with a personal injury attorney.

Try reporting the question in immigration and asking the attorneys there.  As a criminal defense attorney, I can tell you all about possible criminal charges and how a criminal domestic violence case might play out, but I don't know about the standard of proof for granting the petition you're asking about.

1809014,"I am sorry to hear you were hurt. I hope you are better soon.   You ask a good question. You don't want to have medical expenses that the at fault car insurance later refuses to pay. It's a difficult question to answer, however, because Georgia law does not prohibit the insurance company from telling you one thing now and doing something altogether different later. In fact, in my experience, it is common for claims handlers to lull folks into a false sense of security by promising to pay all related bills early in the case but later breaking that promise.   You might want to keep in mind that the insurance company has a massive advantage over you in this situation. They have deep pockets and extensive experience navigating these claims. They are a business and their business is to settle claims for low dollar amounts whenever they can. The claims handler you are dealing with has been trained in techniques to manipulate you and the claim in order to keep the insurance company from having to pay full value.   One technique the claims handler will use is to try to discount any medical bills you present. They will ""audit"" the bills, which is their way of telling you that the bills were unreasonably high. They often do this even when the bills are reasonable. The $2500 coinsurance expense you mention is unlikely to be reimbursed in full by the insurance company, no matter what assurances the handler gives you.   To try and answer you question as directly as possible, telling the insurance company about all of your treatment won't accomplish much because you can't trust what they say. It won't necessarily hurt to tell them but don't put much stock in what they say and be careful what you say. Get the treatment you need. Assume you may have significant out-of-pocket costs that are not reimbursed. Prioritize getting better. Let the insurance chips fall where they may. That's about the best you can do on your own.   Or you could ask an attorney to help you. We are trained to fight these battles for you. We often can get you the treatment you need on a lien (no out of pocket). It costs you nothing to hire an attorney because of contingency fees. I've never had a client end up owning one cent to a doctor - always get the bills paid and almost always there is something left over to compensate my client for all they went through.   Please consider talking to a local attorney who specializes in injury claims. I think you'll be glad you did. Whatever you decide, best wishes to you."
1798824,"As has already been stated the worst thing you can do is try to hide your community service.

1804523,"There is no legal duty for you to trim (personally or by hiring someone) your plants that protrude into the neighbor's land. The neighbor has a legal right to trim the plants to the property line as long as the neighbor does not cause the plants to die. Once the neighbor trims, the neighbor must find legal ways to dispose of the trimmings. The neighbor cannot throw the trimmings onto your property.  Legally, how young or old or how capable of physical work you and the neighbor are is not relevant. The law applies to everyone equally.  Legality aside, it is your hedge. Unless you do not mind that the neighbor trims it in an ugly way, you should hire someone to do the work so that you can control the quality of the work.  If you hire someone to do the work, your neighbor is not legally responsible for any payment to the person you hire. Your neighbor also does not have any legal duty to allow you onto their land to do the work.  If the hedge needs ongoing maintenance, perhaps it is time to cut it down and plant something that does not require as much maintenance."

2066213,"I am sorry about the difficulty your wife is having.  Being the Personal Representative of an estate is quite a responsibility and having the other beneficiaries lined up against the PR makes it that much more difficult.  There are several issues involved in your question and you've mentioned two different possible court matters--Petition for PR Commissions and Petition for Removal of PR.  My first question to you is:  has she filed her Petition for PR commissions?  If so, I'm sure you realize that the Interested Persons only have 20 days to respond to the Petition.  From what you've said, I can't quite tell whether they've already testified in a hearing and you want to bring a defamation or slander suit; or whether you are anticipating their testimony in the hearing regarding her Petition for PR Commissions.  You also discussed the possibility of the other beneficiaries trying to remove your wife as PR.  Have they filed a Petition for Removal of Personal Representative?  If so, again, you only have 20 days to respond to that Petition.  The hearings for PR Commissions and for Removal of PR all occur in the Orphan's Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.  I have experience in these types of matters so I can try to advise about how these things happen generally.  Have these hearings already happened?  Your questions is formed as a ""yes"" or ""no"" question, but I want to make sure you're asking the right question.  If there have been hearings and persons have lied in those hearings, then, ""yes,"" you can file suit against them for causes of action such as defamation of character or slander.  When you talk about wanting to impeach a witness's testimony--that happens in court on cross-examination.  So, ""yes,"" you can try to impeach their testimony during the hearing.  That leads me back to my confusion--have the hearings taken place already?  I recommend that you meet in person with an attorney who has experience in litigation before the Orphan's Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.  I offer free initial consultations, so I'm sure many other attorneys would as well.  I understand your frustration and it must be difficult for you and your wife.  The statute is clear, however, about PR Commissions and Removal of PRs.  The appointment of a PR is a right that the Courts do not easily take away without good cause.  The Orphan's Court is the judicial body that ensures that the deceased's last wishes are followed, and that includes honoring the deceased's choice for Personal Representative.  Best of luck.  And please check your limitations periods if Petitions already have been filed."

1782001,"First, sorry about the situation you are in.  Based on the immediate family interest and potential financial outcome, it appears this Judge should recuse himself.  Two sections of Title 28 of the United States Code (the Judicial Code) provide standards for judicial disqualification or recusal. Section 455, captioned ""Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge,"" provides that a federal judge ""shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" The same section also provides that a judge is disqualified ""where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding""; when the judge has previously served as a lawyer or witness concerning the same case or has expressed an opinion concerning its outcome; or when the judge or a member of his or her immediate family has a financial interest in the outcome of the proceeding.  Best of luck!"
1785556,"Unless this ""lawn company,"" has assets, and I seriously doubt they do, you are very unlikely to get paid through a civil action, and likely cost you more than the value of the service they did not complete.  I would probably chalk this one up as a valuable lesson learned: for example, only do business with experienced and reputable companies that are licensed and bonded.  You could also try the criminal complaint route but unless they have done this kind of thing before, or never had the intention of cutting your lawn, I doubt that will fly as well.  It's not necessarily a criminal matter just because someone did not perform on a contract."

For example, if someone pays a utility bill, insurance, or car payment on your behalf, that income is not attributed to you. The important thing is that the person must pay the bill directly.

If there was not a cross-motion, you need to request oral argument to advise the court of this and if the court refuses to give you oral argument, you need to call the judges law clerk and advise them there never was a previous CIS and do it before the motion is decided. You must advise the court there never was a previous CIS or your motion might be denied on procedural deficiencies."

1829558,"The laws of our country and in California can be harsh.  Unfortunately, employees and job applicants have very few employment rights, and employers have a lot of leeway in how they choose to run their businesses. In general, an employer can be unfair, obnoxious or bad at management. And an employer can make decisions based on faulty or inaccurate information.  An employer has no obligation to warn an employee that he or she is not performing as the employer wants. It‰Ûªs not a level playing field. An employer hires employees to provide work for its benefit, not for the benefit of the employees. Don't expect the employer to take care of its employees; it doesn‰Ûªt have to and it rarely does.  There are some limitations on what an employer can do, mostly in the areas of public policy (such as discrimination law or whistle blowing), contract law, union-employer labor relations, and constitutional due process for government employees. Please see my guide to at-will employment in California which should help you understand employment rights: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/an-overview-of-at-will-employment-all-states.  After you take a look at the guide, you may be able to identify actions or behavior that fits one of the categories that allows for legal action. If so, an experienced plaintiffs employment attorney may be helpful.  For example, if there is evidence that your boss harasses only female employees, or all the female employees, you may be able to move forward with a claim.  Unlawful harassment is a form of discrimination.  To be unlawful, the harassment must be must be based on a protected category, such as race, sex, religion, disability, age (40 and over), pregnancy, or genetic information.  Harassment is also illegal if it is based on whistleblower status, taking or needing family leave, or some other protected category.  An employer is required to provide a workplace free of unlawful harassment.  Harassment can include verbal conduct, slurs, derogatory comments, comments or questions about a person's body, appearance, religious, or sexual activity, or indication of stereotyping. Harassment can also include offensive gestures, sexually suggestive eye contact or looks, mimicking the employee in an insulting way, and derogatory or graphic posters, cartoons or drawings.  Harassment is unlawful when the conduct is either severe or pervasive enough to create an abusive environment.  Severe conduct would include most physical contact and many types of threatening, vulgar or degrading conduct.  Pervasive conduct is widespread, happens frequently and/or in many situations.  One offensive statement is not pervasive, but the same comment made over and over again may be pervasive.   You should know that attorneys who handle discrimination cases must be very selective in the cases they accept.  Just an ordinary discrimination case (if there is such a thing!) can easily run up over $100,000 in attorney's fees due to the large number of hours an attorney must put into such a case.  With that kind of time expenditure, attorneys must choose the cases they take carefully, and they usually select those that have a strong likelihood of success.    That said, not all attorneys see things the same way so it doesn't hurt to try. To find a plaintiffs employment attorney in California, please go to the web site of the California Employment Lawyers Association (CELA).  CELA is the largest and most influential bar association in the state for attorneys who represent working people. The web site is www.cela.org. Click on ""Find a CELA Member"" and you can search by location and practice area. Many CELA attorneys represent clients throughout the state.  I hope there is a good resolution to this situation."

1822079,"As Mr. Fusillo pointed out, this would be a violation of the FCCPA  where you may be entitled to $1,000.00 penalty and actual damages. We see this kind of foolishness from many landlords who, while exempt from the FDCPA, and not exempt from the FCCPA, Fla. Stat. 559.72."
1996243,"The police officer will not be involved, in Missouri the Prosecuting Attorney will determine if a charge is amended or not.  Here once the case gets to Court the police officer is a witness.  While it maybe possible for you to get an amended charge on your own it is pretty unlikely.  Many municipal Prosecuting Attorneys will not negotiate with defendants and of course the Judge can only take a plea to the current charge or set the case for trial.  A lot depends on exactly which court you are going to be in.  If you want a non moving violation you should hire an attorney.  I know I have done many of these myself and it is not very expensive to hire an attorney for a traffic ticket."

1811580,"I agree with my colleague, in NJ the prosecutor's file is not part of the 'public file' the public is entitled to review just by asking for it. On the other hand, as a victim, you are entitled to call the Victim-Witness Unit at the County Prosecutor's Office, and they should be able to help you get some of the information you are looking for, and tell you what steps you need to take to get anything else, depending on your need for that additional imnformation. I changed the area of law to Criminal Defense, as that is the area (given the prior criminal act against you) that seemed most appropriate to your inquiry, given your limited facts."
1791875,"If everything is as you indicate, you will appear back at court with no counsel and no one prepared to stand your bond.

1760283,Look up your case on the Denton county website to see what the charge was or consult with a criminal defense attorney. If there was a conviction for misdemeanor assault and a finding of family violence that could be used against you. The recruiter will want you to get a copy of the judgment.
1796536,Good. Why are you asking questions here when you paid over $5000 to an attorney. Address questions to him or her. Your case sounds good but he or she has the police report that none of us have. Therefore he or she is in the best position to answer these quality questions. Good luck to you. I hope you get a dismissal on the criminal case and win at the DMV hearing so that you can retain your license. Good luck.
1805602,"I agree with my colleague but since I once sat on the BOE as the Deputy State Controller, Taxation, I can offer some specific advice.  You can start with Collections at 916-445-3670 or the Taxpayer Advocate Office at 916-324-2796 if you do not get an answer from Collections.  The telephone number that I have provided to you is the direct number for Todd Gilman, Chief of that department.  He is extremely helpful and can get to the bottom of this.  Good luck!"

The SB process, if approved, is much faster and does not cost as much."
2072383,"Whether you can ""pick her up anytime"" will depend on the guardianship papers and whether you have an order for any type of custody/visitation.  Honestly, you need to have legal counsel. If you can pay to support your daughter, you must be able to pay an attorney at least something to assist you. If you don't have an attorney, you risk losing and what then?? You won't have your daughter.  I wish you the best."
1825350,"This would probably be a good time to consult with an elder law attorney so that you can make fully informed decisions.  There are a few issues here.  First, you are saying ""assisted living facility.""  Are you sure that it is an ALF and not a skilled nursing facility?  It would be unusual for someone to be in an ALF for rehabilitation.  The usual progression is hospital to SNF and then either home or to an ALF.  Medicaid does not normally pay for Assisted Living care, only skilled nursing.  The family MIGHT qualify for State-County Special Assistance (which is sometimes erroneously called ""Medicaid"" but is actually a waiver program).  The income limits are low and many people do not qualify.  In any event, with Medicaid or Special Assistance, the patient's income is typically paid to the facility (minus a small personal needs allowance) and the program makes up the difference between what the patient has paid and the cost of care.  There would not be an allowance to permit the patient to continue paying the mortgage.  And as a prior poster paid, if the mortgage is not paid, then there is a risk of foreclosure.  Speaking with an elder law attorney may help the family make some decisions here, including whether a family member can/should pay the mortgage...  Medicaid benefits paid out are recouped by the State through estate recovery when the patient dies.  Again, this is a MAJOR reason you need to talk with an experienced elder law attorney because there are many issues here.  Depending on several specifics that are not clear from your question, yes, the house COULD be at risk.  We'd have to be confident about the level of care, the public benefit being used or sought and several other issues to give you fully accurate advice.  I strongly suggest contacting an elder law attorney right away since you are saying that this admission may become lengthy and possibly permanent."
1669927,"Yes your employer can discover criminal convictions through a background check. They may not be able to obtain your answers on this specific form, however, they will obtain copies of your criminal convictions If those criminal convictions are pertinent to the job you are applying for, they will likely not hire you. If you complete an employment application that asks about your criminal record, you must be honest in your answers, or you can later be terminated when they discover your lack of truthfulness. Best of luck!"
1795404,This is not a question but a rant (that I agree with)
1823662,"I want to provide more insight to your answer but am a bit confused by your comment to Counselor Borah, wherein you essentially state that you received no formal termination and are happy to take your leave to pursue other positions, since you are now receiving permanent disability and not able to do the work that you previously performed.  Before you read the rest of my comment, confirm whether you are receiving temporary disability or permanent disability.  If you are receiving temporary disability, just peruse my answer and seek counsel if you have not done so already.  As you probably know, ""PD"" is an acronym for permanent disability.  Your permanent disability payments/advances will not cease if you separate from the company with whom you sustained your industrial injury.  If you're receiving additional income in addition to permanent disability during your ""leave"" then it sounds like you hit an unusual sweet spot with your situation.  If you are simply receiving permanent disability (advances) and not temporary disability, I would demand that my employer offer me modified work or fire me; this should not impact your ongoing permanent disability payments.  In fact, you may apply for unemployment and receive such payment (insofar as money is available to you for unemployment) on top of your permanent disability payments if you are fired AND are ready, willing and able to work but cannot find employment.  In addition, your termination may give rise to an employment law claim for which you would need to speak directly with an attorney who is well-versed in employment law."
2660006,"Unfortunately, this is a much more complicated problem now than it was before judgment was entered.  I have explained here on a number of occasions to people that, when their names are included as defendants in foreclosure cases, even if they are no the borrower(s), unless they take the right action to ensure that the judgment does not impact them improperly, they are at risk for serious consequences, exactly as you are describing.  Examples of this problem are tenants like yourself, non-borrower spouses, heirs of deceased borrowers, etc.  Foreclosure cases are typically filed by factory like ""volume firms"", who use generic complaints and even more generic judgment language, which compounds the problem. Frustratingly, I see responses from non-borrower defendants telling them not to worry...  It might still be possible to seek to vacate the judgment, and perhaps even to seek sanctions against the foreclosure firm, depending on the details.  However, it will be tricky, and not ""typical"" defense, so you need to make sure to retain the services of an attorney who really understands how to do what I am describing.  We have been successful with situations like you are describing, which is why I KNOW it is a problem for non-borrower defendants."
1791172,You are free to do anything and go anywhere you want so long as you don't exceed the restrictions placed on you by your treating doctor.  I would not tell the insurance before I go as that may cause them to try to film you with your luggage.  They are supposed to give you 10 days notice of any appointment so being gone 5 days should be O.K.
1793100,"It is paid by the estate.  See probate code 6540 et seq and specifically 6544 ""The costs of proceedings under this chapter shall be paid by the estate as expenses of administration"".  This means that it will be accounted for as an expense ""off the top"" and in effect the grown children will have their share reduced by that expense."
1801244,The law related to this situation is not really one specific to employment/labor law and therefore you might benefit from posting this in another practice area.  This issue relates generally to credit reporting and your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  I suggest you post in the Debt Collection practice area where you will get attorneys who are very familiar with that law.  Good luck to you.
1805007,"If you are waiting 5 years of residency rather than trying to naturalize based on 3 years of marriage to US citizen, then the issue of the marriage is not a big factor for the naturalization.  If you're trying to get it based on the 3 years of marriage to US citizenship, then you have to prove that the marriage is still viable marriage.  However, if you divorced and waited the 5 years to apply, they usually will not focus on the marriage."
1820631,"Yes it is common to need to fill out some forms to provide information on your finances.  Some lawyers will get a credit report for you.  If you don't understand the forms, call the attorney to set up an appointment so you can get some help.  If the attorney won't help you, find someone else."
1279362,"You have a First Amendment right to record officers in public performing their duties.  They may say otherwise, but they are wrong.  As my colleague stated, however, you need to be careful not to cross the line.  Where the line is may not always be clear, but use common sense.  Of course, common sense does not always prevail.  I have seen people convicted by a jury for ""disturbing the peace"" when what they were doing was not only legal but protected under the First Amendment.  So, in theory you can record them, but be aware that there might be consequences and have the number of a good criminal defense/civil rights attorney handy.  If you are charged, remain silent and contact a criminal defense attorney immediately."
1803050,"Based upon the information provided, it does not sound as if she has enough evidence at this time, HOWEVER, I caution you not to contact her anymore for any reason.

(You do not say your have been here for six months, but it sounds like it.)  For the divorce, basically, Texas is a first to file state, but the issues can get complicated. You need a good lawyer to help you. You will probably need one here and one in California (at least for a while). Good luck."
1821508,"There are some further questions that need to be answered. As far as DCFS being notified, if the arresting officer said he was going to notify them, I would believe him.  How they proceed will probably be based on a number of factors. Was the child/children present in the motel? Is your brother the father? Does he live with the girlfriend? Typically DCFS does not look favorably on mothers who associate with people doing meth.  As far as why your brother did not have a court appearance, this may be because the District Attorney has not yet filed a complaint. Just because his girlfriend's case was rejected, does not mean that the D.A. is not still considering filing on your brother. After an arrest, the D.a. has up to one year to file on a misdemeanor, and up to three years to file on a felony.  In the mean time, make sure your brother does not speak with ANYONE, concerning this matter, (especially the D.A.'office and law enforcement, other than a call to the D.A. to see if they have filed on the case). Anything he says can and will be used against him, and he has the right to not talk with anyone. Speaking with a lawyer may be in his best interest."
1818687,"$10,000, except that a plaintiff may not file a claim over $2,500 more than twice a year. Limit for local public entity or for businesses is $5,000. $6,500 is the limit in suits by an individual against a guarantor that charges for its guarantor or surety services."
1826916,"If the case is handled properly, you may be able to keep it off your record.  You need the help of a good criminal defense attorney.  Theft 5th is a simple misdemeanor, which carries a maximum jail sentence of 30 days and a maximum fine of $625.00.  But a theft conviction may keep you out of certain forms of employment, and may make you ineligible for some types of professional licensing.  A deferred judgment would allow you to avoid a permanent stain on your record.  You need to hire a lawyer to assist you.  If you can't afford one, ask the court for an application for court appointed counsel.  Some municipal judges may try to force you to proceed without appointing an attorney to represent you--on the theory that you are only entitled to a state funded lawyer if you risk going to jail--where they do not intend to send you to jail if you are guilty.  If this happens, you should (1) enter a plea of not guilty; (2) request a jury trial; and (3) sell something to get the money to hire a private attorney.  The criminal justice system is difficult to navigate, and unless you want this incident to be a permanent stain on your record, you need the help of an attorney."
1792919,You should complete form I-130 with the information pertinent to her most recent arrival in the U.S.  Please see
1799201,"To prove the conspiracy, the State need just present evidence showing that you were involved in planning, organizing, or taking part in the crime of distributing marijuana, along with evidence that SOMEONE in the conspiracy group took a step towards the commission of the crime.  They need not show that you actually did anything, only that you discussed it with others and that they took a step towards completing the crime.  I believe it would be an affirmative defense, on your part (and your burden), to show that you had removed yourself from the conspiracy AND that you communicated that to the others PRIOR to any of them taking any steps toward the commission of the crime.  So, to answer your question more simply - you MAY have the ability to show that you removed yourself from the conspiracy, but that is probably going to be something YOU have to prove.  I don't think the Court would require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you did NOT remove yourself from the conspiracy.  They would need only prove that you were involved in the initial discussions/planning.    Keep in mind that conspiracy is a separate charge from the underlying crime itself.  It can be illegal to plan a crime, as long as one participate takes a step towards completing the crime, even if the crime does not end up being completed (i.e. planning a bank robbery could constitute conspiracy as soon as someone gathers the gun to be used in the robbery, even if the robbery isn't actually carried out ... the crime is in the planning ... it would be a separate charge for the actual robbery if one of the participants then carried it out).  Good luck!"

1804361,"I see this question all the time. In fact, that is the main defense to many workers compensation and personal injury claims. People can recover from a per-existing injury and that resulting condition makes them more susceptible to an injury in the future. In Florida, you have to prove the accident is the major contributing cause of the need for medical care and resulting disability. The insurance company will fight that in order to avoid paying the claim.  They fight the claim by contending the condition pre-existed the accident and, therefore, they should not be held accountable to pay for the treatment.  I recently won a case involving the need for back surgery.  The adjuster contended the back condition pre-existed the accident and refused to authorize the surgery.  I deposed the treating doctor and he agreed the accident caused the need for the surgery and won.  It's not easy to win these cases, so you have to be aggressive.  Good luck."
1808105,I cannot think of a reason why she would NOT be violated.  Shoplifting while on probation for another theft offense--burglary--is never a good idea and will not likely be overlooked by the probation department nor the court.
1827823,I believe a similar message was posted previously. This one is just confusing. A child support case with the state may be closed if the oblige does not cooperate. That does not mean childbsupport is terminated if payments are being made directly to the recipient.
1790293,"So here's what you need to do -- contact an attorney in the state where the warrant is issued and have the attorney negotiate with the prosecutor to remove the warrant.  It sounds easy, but it isn't and likely to take some time and several meetings because they will prefer that you come back and be prosecuted.  Once the warrant is removed then you can move on peacefully.  If the warrant remains in effect then there's the likelihood that every time you're stopped you will be incarcerated for up to five days."
1811088,"Dear Tenant:  There is no prohibition from a Landlord taking pictures especially if they can say that they were trying to photograph the damage or repair.  I would not hesitate to ask the manager, as you did, to not take pictures of any other area in your unit.  You should consider bringing this to the attention of the Landlord.  The Landlord may not be aware of the manager's activities.  If you do, document it in writing and keep a copy.  Hope this helps.  Good luck."
1791973,"Grandparent visitation rights are allowed under Alabama law (30-3-4.1 Code of Alabama) for the parent of a deceased parent of a minor.  You qualify for that.  Alabama also allows the parent of a deceased parent to intervene in an adoption proceeding when a step-parent is trying to adopt.  This does not mean the adoption will be stopped but you may get visitation rights. Many of the grandparent rights have been eliminated by the US Supreme Court.  I do not recall a USSC decision dealing with a case like yours.  If you are being asked for consent, which is not required, I think that is a good sign.  Ask if one weekend a month for grandparent visitation could be included in the adoption matter.  If the former son-in-law says he will always include you ask what if he dies.  Will the new mother do the same when she remarries? It sounds like you have a good chance of working this out.  Do not wait too long."
1820157,"Yes, you made a mistake.  And, as my colleagues pointed out ... it will probably be returned to you.  I suggest that, while you're waiting, you contact your bank to see if the check has been cashed."

1810415,"Mr. Berkus has a point there.  You will have to retain counsel to defend the deficiency claim and prove the forgery.  If it turns out they forged the document and stole the rents, then its another story. It opens up the whole foreclosure case.  I would suggest that you click on ""Find a Lawyer"" above and locate an attorney that specializes in foreclosure defense."
1806989,"Yes it is possible.  He will still be entitled to notice but his lack of contact may make his consent unnecessary.  The only problem you have is that he has paid child support.  If he doesn't pay for a year, you plead abandonment and then you can allege that his consent is unnecessary."

1823854,"If the mortgagor is in default, or threatening to, sometimes a ""deed in lieu of foreclosure"" can be a good way for the mortgagee to take the property back quickly. If two past years' worth of taxes haven't been paid, the mortgagor could lose the property soon--and your interest as mortgagee would also be imperiled. Talk to a lawyer about putting together an agreement with your borrower, or if that cannot be done, foreclosing quickly. Good luck."
1823992,"First, you likely need a lawyer to represent your interest. If the money that the alleged father gave was strictly for diapers and some form of clothing, the court ""may"" not give him credit for that as child support. Parents buy stuffs all the time for their kids and it is not considered child support."
1819787,"He is trying to abuse you further. Don't let him.  Hire a lawyer. Ask for child support at guidelines, spousal support if you qualify, and supervised visitation.  It sounds like he may never exercise the visitation but you could enforce the support obligation with contempt/jail. Your child is entitled to that support.   It is unlikely that a judge would let him relinquish unless you had a new husband adopting."
1789717,"An employer is not permitted to require that female employees wear men's uniforms.  (An employer could require its employees to wear unisex uniforms, however.)  If pointing this out to the company doesn't resolve the issue, you should consider contacting the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and filing a complaint (assuming you feel that the issue is worth pressing that far)."
1790154,"Yes, you should definitely hire a private attorney. You want an altered visitation plan. This is not something that the OAG usually handles. In addition, the OAG does not represent you or your interests. If an altered visitation plan is important, then you should try to hire an attorney. Use the Find a Lawyer tab at the top of the page to locate an experienced family law attorney in your area. You can also look to see if there is legal aid in your area. Best of Luck."
1825815,"Sorry to disagree with my colleagues but federal law limits estate recovery to Medicaid after age 55 except in limited cases so no estate recovery against a 43 year old unless those limited circumstances that would not be the norm apply.

2056024,"I assume the police arrested you for resisting without violence under Fla.Stat. Section 843.02. This is often used as a catch-all charge when citizens exercise their First Amendment rights to record police in public. (Google my name and you'll see that I've handled many of these cases.)   FLA. Stat. Section 768.28 does not apply to federal civil rights violations. When you bring the case in federal court, there are no damage caps. I can assure you, though, that you don't want to handle a federal or state civil rights case on your own.  You must first prevail on the resisting without violence charge. If you take a plea, then you torpedo your civil rights case. You need to hire a criminal defense attorney who is familiar with the constitutional law issues as well as Florida criminal case law regarding Section 843.02. That's why I prefer to handle the underlying criminal defense case myself before I agree to accept the civil rights case.   You have four years after defeating the criminal case to file a lawsuit in state or federal court, but if you intend on filing in state court, you need to file a notice of claim within the first three years. The sovereign immunity statute has several steps that you must strictly obey or your case will fail on a motion to dismiss.   Good luck. Choose your attorney wisely."
1828872,"No, you cannot sue them. I have seen, once--one time, an attorney file a motion for decision, and I would not recommend it."
1802341,"You definitely want to consult with a trust attorney.   That being said, if you are talking about real property, don't be surprised to find out that you do not need to take any action. The trust owns the property and it is simply titled to the trustee as representative of the trust and not in their personal capacity. So if the trustee changes, the ownership did not change, just the representative of the trust. So the trust still owns the property. When the property is sold/transferred to the next person (after the trust) the new deed simply lists the succession of trustees in the document so that the new owner has a deed showing what occurred and why the names don't match.   This is similar to when a married couple owns a property and one of them passes. The other still owns the property and does not need to change anything. If the living spouse sells the property the new deed says that one of the last owners deceased on specific date and time.  If both the couple pass away then the estate sells the property. There is no deed to the estate and them from the estate to the new owner. The estate simply prepares a new deed upon sale with a statement that each of the previous owners deceased on specific date and time and that explains why the names don't match.   You do want to make sure that the taxing entity knows the new address of the new trustee (if it is different) so they can send the tax bill to the proper location.   If you are talking personal property such as a care or truck, the new trustee can go in to the transfer location with the document and their ID (and any resignation of the past trustee or their death certificate if they are deceased) and have the vehicle title updated (but not necessarily have the ownership transferred). Again, the trust owns the property so there is no change of ownership, just a change in the representative of the trust. Either way, make sure you don't pay the ownership transfer fee for nothing.   Be sure to call the transfer location to see what forms they may need.   Hopefully this will give you a starting point to talk with your trust attorney about."
1963111,"Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, only those items that are reporting accurately and who have complied 100% with the back-end record-keeping may report on your credit. Auditing them under those laws is specific and can be complicated because they will reject anything that does not adhere to form. Companies like White, Jacobs & Associates specialize in consumer programs that target inaccurate derogatory items on a credit report and hold the bureau's feet to the fire (they are, after all, money-making institutions and that means that the threat of litigation for Damage to Credit Reputation is a real concern). The audits will require the original creditor and entity reporting to provide a detailed billing history tracing the account from zero to its present reporting balance and provide a copy of the original signed contract within 45 days. Without that, the FCRA says that the item must be deleted.  FCRA audits can be tricky and overwhelming. If you choose to hire a company to do it for you, when searching for a national credit repair organization, pick one with good results, with positive consumer reviews, and that has an attorney attached to it."

(See Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-100(A).  Because individuals (potential clients) come to lawyers in order to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct, and because a lawyer needs a potential client to communicate fully and frankly even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matters, a lawyer may not reveal information relating to the representation, even if that information comes before a client formally retains the attorney."
1804034,"If the child has been in Florida for six month or more then Florida has jurisdiction and Florida law applies, so what they NY lawyer tells you would not apply.  If Florida law applies you have to file an action for paternity to establish your paternity.  The birth certificate gives you a presumption of paternity, but it is not an ""order.""  However, you could file it as part of your action for paternity if you chose.  In Florida, without any prior order, this would not be child abduction.  If the child has not lived in Florida for six months or more then you would have to determine what the child's home state is before having a productive discussion."
1796492,"First of all,  all attorney fees actually incurred before you file are DISCHARGEABLE..but for WORK done after you file the courts have allowed a collection for such under Quantum Meruit Theory for work done. But some attorneys new to this charge like $100 down and $1400 after filing...those are DISCHARGEABLE! You can ask your attorney to itemize for work after you filed, or if you don't pay, that is the mess..will they do anything about it? Don't know..probably not but who knows! That is the problem an attorney creates if not paid for all before filing.   Second, you do NOT have to ANSWER anything. They simply filed motions. You do nothing. Then, after your case is closed you have options as follows:   Third, on the house options:  you should call the court and see if your case is closed about 10 days after you get a discharge or after the hearings set, whichever is later, as until closed the trustee can still sell your house. ""Closed"" is not the same as ""Discharged"", so call and ask if closed and if so, you might add that to your listed facts also.  Under your state law, if the actual foreclosure has not yet taken place, then you have options (1) live there as long as you can for free instead of paying rent somewhere else; (2) if closed, move out and rent your place until the renters have to finally leave; (3) move out and leave it vacant (you wont receive any monies or save any though); (4) move out and let someone you know live there till they have to leave; (5) see if the bank will pay you for a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure (maybe they will pay you $2,000 or whatever you agree to..try for $3000 first and see what they say (they may not want to accept such a deed if there are underlying mortgages or liens that they can eliminate by conducting a formal sale.   Please remember that if in fact there are any Homeowners Assocation Dues (HOA), that any such HOA due and payable post petition until the property is not in your name are not discharged (only prepetition HOA past due dues are discharged). Technically you could also keep living there until you commit an unlawful detainer and then they can proceed with going through the law to force a formal eviction but in such case you may end up possibly owing fees and costs for unlawful detainer. Most lenders would rather NOT just have property left vacant as it often invites vagrants or persons vandalizing. Good luck and I hope my answer assists you."

At this hearing, the defendant will be informed of the charges and will have bail set.  The rules require this hearing be held within a reasonable amount of time and without undue delay following an arrest.  As you may know, the criminal justice process isn't the most efficient and often delayed.  I would be somewhat surprised to hear that your friend has been in custody for a month without being told the nature of the charges filed against him or other basis for his detention.  You must also be aware that a new arrest will often prompt the issuance of a probation detainer that will hold a person in custody despite bail being set and paid on the new case.  Your friend needs a lawyer immediately.  The lack of information contained above, the length of detention to date, and a 7 year probationary sentence could be more problematic than a simple technical violation for taking a sip of alcohol.

You did not mention children, so I am going on the assumption that there is none and that the only matters before the court will be to divide property and debts you both may have.

2002242,"Some basic rules.   1. California is a Community Property (CP) state.  2. All property acquired during a marriage, when contemplating or engaged in a divorce, is considered CP.  3. Your spouse cannot sell the property without your signature if its a significant asset, and if its your principal residence, it cannot be sold without your signature either.  4. If there was a mortgage taken out on the property, then the debt is marital debt, hence a CP debt.  5. In a divorce, its likely that all the equity  in the home would be presumed to be all CP. The reason why is that once Separate Property is commingled with CP, its all presumed CP and its your spouse's burden to prove that the $50,000.00 in equity in the home was intended to be her property alone.  There is a recent case from the CA Supreme Court, In re Marriage of Valli, link here:  http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-supreme-court/1666906.html  In the Valli case the supreme court explained that title in the wife's name alone was insufficient to make it her separate property.   Your spouse would have to prove that her $50,000.00 was not a gift to the community. She would also have to prove any remaining equity is also not CP. Finally, she would have to prove that the CP would not be liable on the underlying real estate note in the event the lender chooses to sue under the note and surrender the property.  Personally, I think she has a tough sell on this one."
558772,"Assuming your son is an adult and also assuming that there was no reason to refuse him permission to drive the car registered in your name (addictions, epilepsy or other diseases, suspension of license due to a pile of past accidents, etc.)  everything said by both counsel is correct. Your(and your wife's)  liability as the registered owners is limited in California to 15/30/5 thousands. See Vehicle Code Section 17151. Your policy exceeds this limit.  While you are not in a position to judge the nature and extent of injuries sustained by other vehicle occupants, they may be less and more that your policy limit. If after litigation the court determines that your son caused damage beyond the policy limit and enters judgment against him to that effect, he will be a judgment debtor and generally such a debt can be discharged in bancrupcy.  When my clients are aware that the injury is serious and they have assets (your son does not) I recommend that they write to the liability insurance company and ask them to offer the policy limit(s) to the other party. This has to be in writing and I always tell them to send it certified and to keep a copy in their file. This way if the verdict or judgement is in excess of the policy they have some protection against the insurance company due to its failure to tender the policy limit if the other party asked for it.

These drug interaction cases are very hard to prove and cost a fortune to prove.  Unless the damages are very serious, probably no lawyer will even consider taking the case.

1805122,"I agree that you do not have to assist the plaintiff in getting your LLC served and if no service is the end result you may be okay.  This is a process, however that I have seen backfire on clients that I have represented over the years.  Thus I would recommend that you at least consult with an attorney and monitor the case docket at least every few weeks.  First issue is where is the Registered Agent?  Under Florida law, this person must be at this address during certain hours each business day.  If the agent is no longer at that address or is not present when required, process might be served on a number of people at the LLC's place of business, on others involved in the LLC and even in some situations on the person at a business like Mailboxes, etc. If those fail and the registered agent isn't available as required by law, process might even be served on the State of Florida and if your last known address for the LLC is no longer functioning or providing you with information about mail received, a judgment could be entered against the LLC after serving the State.  Hence the need to monitor the case.  You may believe that if the LLC is belly up, you don't have to worry about a judgment, but there situations that require an extensive attorney conference, where the veil of the LLC separation between it and your assets can be pierced to get at your assets and once there is a judgement against the LLC, the defenses to the lawsuit can't be raised if the veil is pierced.

New York State does not provide by statute a right to a walk through or an inspection and allows landlords and tenants to come to their own terms relating to the security deposit and the end of lease as long as those terms do not conflict with State law.  You must be on your own guard to preserve the evidence that the apartment was turned over in an undamaged condition.  How do you plan to get the keys to the landlord? If the landlord will come to the apartment to receive the keys, then that seems to be the time for the inspection. You must remove all possessions, and sweep the apartment (broom clean is the ancient term used in most New York residential leases). If the landlord will not look around, you cannot force the issue.

1796213,"As well as under the  laws of several states, there is a Federal law called the ""WARN"" Act (an acronym for ""Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act"") at 29 USCS å¤å¤ 2101 et seq.   The purpose of the WARN Act is to give workers and their families some transition time to prepare for the prospective loss of employment, to seek a new job, and, if necessary, to seek training in a new skill or retraining in an existing skill that will allow the workers to obtain replacement work. Basically, it provides that companies with 100 or more full-time employees must provide 60 days advance notice of a ""plant closing"" or a ""mass layoff."" A mass layoff occurs when one third or more of the work force is laid off, with a minimum of 50 employees. While there are some narrow ""faltering businesses"" exceptions, the WARN Act generally requires most employers with 100 or more employees to provide employees, bargaining representatives of the employees (i.e., unions), and specific government agencies at least 60 days notice of any plant closing and mass layoff. Alternatively, an employer may pay 60 calendar days of wages in lieu of notice.    More specifically, it applies to any business enterprise that employs (A) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or (B) 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week (exclusive of hours of overtime).    The Act defines a ""plant closing"" as the permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any 30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding any part-time employees. WARN doesn't just apply to business closings, but to the sale of all or part of the assets of a business.  In that case, the Act provides that the seller is required to provide notice up to and including the date of the sale.  After that date, the buyer is responsible for providing notice, unless the buyer re-hires seller's employees at the time of the sale.  Under WARN, an employee gets prior notice and little else.  Except perhaps under a State law (Pennsylvania is not one of them) an employer is not required to pay any kind of severance at all, unless it is required under the company's written employee handbook, or under a provable policy of always paying severance. A fairly common type of severance policy among larger employers provides for one week of pay for each year of service. Thus, if an employee with 25 years of service is laid off in a plant closing, the employer‰Ûªs policy might grant that employee 25 weeks of pay.  There is nothing to prevent an employee from personally approaching the employer and negotiating  for a higher rate of severance than that offered.  An employer who violates the WARN Act notice requirement is liable to each affected employee for an amount equal to back pay and benefits for the period of violation up to 60 days. An employer who fails to provide notice as required to a unit of local government is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day of violation. The penalty may be avoided if the employer satisfies the liability to each affected employee within 3 weeks after the closing.   Normally, there is no specific time (other than a ""reasonable"" time) that an employee must be allowed to consider or reject an offer to release claims. However, if you are asked to waive an age discrimination claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, you are entitled to a written statement giving you 21 days to consider the agreement before signing, and 7 days after signing the agreement during which you may revoke your signature. Typically, to be qualified to apply for and receive state unemployment  you need to have lost your job ""through no fault of your own.""  If you turn down the severance offer, unemployment compensation should be available depending on all the facts."

Although certain common law rights are conferred, trademarking a name with the USPTO is best and gives the most protection to pursue infringers in the future.

1826488,"When you are dealing with a CDR, you typically do have to come up with a retainer, and this is because most people will be collecting their benefits pending the CDR and a possible appeal if they lost the initial review - i.e. there is no potential back benefits from which the SSA could calculate a 25% award, nor from which it can be the attorney.  As such, usually the retainer is between $2000-$4000, and it typically only gets paid to the attorney if you win your CDR.

1799409,"I understand that your situation is very difficult, and the loss of the Medicaid that she is receiving because of the SSI can often be more costly than actually losing the payment. Unfortunately, there as the attorneys have stated, there is very little that can be done to preserve her Medicaid when your earnings will cause her to lose her benefit.   My suggestion would be that you look into the changes that have occurred with Healthcare coverage since the Obamacare provisions have went into effect earlier this year. It is possible that even if your wife loses Medicaid based on her SSI eligibility, she may continue to be eligible due to the expansion of the program as a result of the Obamacare changes. If she is not eligible for Medicaid, if your income is the only income in the household, it is likely that you both would be entitled to substantial subsidies for purchasing healthcare coverage through a healthcare exchange.  Although most employees never want to thing about this, the other option is to ask your employer to limit your hours so that you do not exceed the maximum allowed, or if you are absolutely needed for the hours that you are working, determining if your pay can be decreased. Maybe offer your employer to take a pay cut if you are provided with more vacation time in exchange.   If your wife was the one that was working, she would have many additional options available to her. She could use Impairment Related Work Expenses to reduce the impact of earnings on her SSI amount, or continue to be eligible for Medicaid while she returns to work. For more information about the programs available for your wife, see the following: http://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-work-ussi.htm.   I am sorry that none of us have been able to provide more helpful information to you, but I wish you and your wife good luck!"

As to whether or not you can end the delays and force a trial date, that is something a good family law attorney can tell you based on reviewing all of the current documents from the case (so you will want to take those with you to an initial consultation).  I'd suggest using the ""find a lawyer"" tab here on Avvo to start your search for representation."

1794257,"There are several different interlocks, with different error messages, that are approved for use in Michigan.  You should have a booklet or user's manual for your interlock, and it may have a section in it describing the meaning of each error message.  You may also be able to go online and find the manual and the error messages.  Your message may mean that the unit is not properly linking with the interlock company's record keeping technology.  It may be happening at other times and you are not even aware that it is happening.  I suggest that you go to your installer and have the unit checked.  The Secretary of State is getting very strict about interlock problems, seeming to take the approach that you are doing something wrong and re-revoking you, and then you have to have a hearing to try to convince them that the interlock was messing up, and that you didn't do anything wrong.  Get it checked out.  Sincerely,  Frank B. Ford"
1806270,"Most trustees, who are also beneficiaries, will not a take a trustee fee since it reduced their inheritance which is tax free. Trustee's must pay income tax on earned trustee fees. For a small estate under $150,000 any trustee fee should be very small, IMO and justified by adequate time records which produced a benefit to the trust estate."
1792794,"If you both agree it is not a marital asset, why is it being left in a joint account for even one more day? Or has it already been there long enough that memories have faded and greed has set in?.   It's time to fully document a paper trail of where it came from and how it got to where it is (bank action, not a gift by you.).   And unless you are under a court order to not do anything, as it is in a joint account, move that amount to a new account, and keep that as part of the paper trail s well.  Caveat, if you are represented by counsel, do nothing without covering the matter with counsel."
1789099,"You can expect the case to be set for trial, unless you plead guilty or no contest. My suggestion is that you plead not guilty then go see a criminal defense attorney.  By entering a plea of not guilty, the case will be set for trial or maybe for a pretrial conference before then. Your lawyer should have plenty of time to investigate and prepare a defense to this case.  It looks like you have a good defense. Sitting on a piece of pot does not necessarily constitute possession. That issue has come up on several of my cases and I have won in bench trials.  The fact that it was not your car can help to persuade the judge that you did not know it was there.   It would be a shame for you to plead guilty or no contest, this crime is punishable by a two-year minimum drivers license suspension, possible but not probable jail time and probation, fines and court costs. You might as well pay an attorney and try to come out of it with a clean record."

1805362,"It is unclear whether the three corporations are somehow affiliated, are jointly represented and/or plan on submitting a joint answer to a verified Complaint.  Since a verification to a complaint can be used to effect  a party admission, even if a joint answer were filed and one corporate entity had the authority from the other entities to verify the responsive pleading, it would never be a best practice to have one corporation verify an answer for another corporation.  Each corporate defendant should verify its own pleading.  In California, a corporation cannot represent itself in Court and must be represented by counsel to file its responsive pleading."

1812304,"No money? This is a most ambitious joint venture full of legal pitfalls. You need an attorney and you are smart to start looking now. Your key need is to get your understandings down in proper legal form.  Putting off money allocation until the money behind rolling in is not smart. Guests will set in and the friendships will suffer and likely split apart the business. The default is probably an equal split, but that seldom works in practice as contributions are typically unequal in value and importance and egos set in and often disrupt the fun. Squabble about those finances now and stick to the understandings and the joint venture may survive."

Another path would be to file a VAWA self-petition, which may enable you to obtain lawful permanent resident status without your husband's participation or knowledge. This situation is complex and rather sensitive. I would advise you to consult with an immigration attorney privately before committing to any one course of action. Best of luck!"

3117712,"The answer to your question is ""It depends"" It is correct that all assets acquired during the marriage are subject to division pursuant to Mass General laws ch 208 sec 34 however the court considers at least 18 different factors when making an equitable  division of  property. One important factor is the length of the marriage. If you got married two years ago under this scenario it is likely the court would try and put the two parties back into the position they maintained at the commencement of the marriage. If it is a marriage of 20 years the court would probably consider that the assets had become part of the fabric of the marriage. Was this the second  marriage for you ? Did you have a prenuptial contract? Your best thing to do right now is consult with experienced divorce counsel."
1818481,"I would add that some title companies will issue a homestead endorsement in lieu of a spouse signing, but some lenders do not find that satisfactory either.  If you are certain you are moving forward with a divorce (and I encourage you to make all efforts at reconciliation and counseling first), then you may be best protected getting into the divorce case and having temporary orders entered to address the property situation.  In some respects, you are putting the cart before the horse."
1814814,"You can file for contempt in Arizona for failure to comply with the court order. You would need to make sue that the loan was assigned to her in the final decree, though. Penalties for contempt can include many types of relief including damages to you, so you could even be compensated for the damage to your credit, though this would be hard to quantify and it sounds like your ex may not have much money. If you get relief in the form of a court order allowing you to possess the car, then you could attempt to enforce that order with the police in another state. This question is therefore part theoretical and part practical."
1791711,"Frankly, you should have contacted the police years ago - this is fraud and identity theft.  Your father's wife should be in jail if you're version of events is correct.  I'm concerned, though, about the amount of time that has lapsed and your involvement in making payments, etc.  The time lag may, frankly, preclude making any kind of claim that you're not responsible, and certainly making payments negates any chance that you'll get out of the debt.  I'd advise contacting the local authorities and discussing a criminal case (doubtful, but it can't hurt), and I'd advise speaking with a bankruptcy attorney - it may be your only avenue to get out the debt."
1820732,"The amount of information that must be provided is not extensive.  Essentially, it is knowledge of spouses, children, and sometimes siblings.  If you have old family friends that can attest to being familiar with your father's history, that would likely suffice.

1813935,"The answer depends on whether you already accrued the leave, or if accrual is capped at a certain maximum number of hours.  An employee cannot be forced to forfeit vacation time, as this is considered wages under the Labor Code. An employee can be made to forfeit sick leave. If you have a PTO plan, then you cannot be forced to forfeit any of those hours; because vacation and sick leave are combined, and an employee cannot be made to forfeit vacation, you get to keep the whole thing.  In contrast, if the employer allows a maximum accrual, then it can maintain that limitation. For example, if vacation accrual is capped at 100 hours, the employer may stop adding to the accrual for employees when their accrual reaches 100 hours.  The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) is a sub-agency within the California Department of Industrial Relations.  http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/.  Some people refer to the DLSE as the Labor Commissioner.  The DLSE enforces California's wage and hour laws, including those pertaining to overtime, rest and meal breaks, and more.  Here is what the DLSE Enforcement Manual says about ""use it or lose it"" polices: Vacation plans may not have a ""use it or lose it"" provision as such provision would be an illegal forfeiture. However, a variant of a ""use it or lose it"" policy whereby a cap is placed on the amount of vacation which may accrue if not taken is acceptable. (Henry v. Amrol (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1; see also O.L. 1986.10.28, 1986.11.04, 1986.12.30, 1988.08.04, 1991.01.07, 1998.09.17)  One important caveat to this:  If the reason you have accrued a substantial number of hours is because the employer will never allow you to take vacation, then the employer cannot enforce the cap.  I hope there is a good resolution to this situation."

There would not be a time for you to file anything prior to such a hearing if the will names him to serve as ""independent"" executor.

1796130,"Most Massachusetts employers are prohibited from asking any criminal history questions on an initial job application and thereafter can only obtain limited criminal history during any follow-up interviewing or hiring procedures.  Since late 2010, Massachusetts law has prohibited employers from asking any criminal history questions on initial employment application forms. The law is designed to prevent employers from screening out candidates based criminal history information included in their completed application forms.   This law does not prevent employers from asking certain criminal history questions later in the interview process.  Limited criminal history questions can be asked during an interview and applicants may be required to answer limited criminal history questions in writing  after submitting an initial application form and interviewing for a position.  In those circumstances, an employer still cannot ask about, (a) arrests, detentions, or dispositions where there was no criminal conviction, (b) first convictions for drunkenness, simple assault, speeding, minor traffic violations, affray, or disturbance of the peace or (c) misdemeanor convictions more than five years old, (unless the incarceration ended within the last five years or the applicant has been convicted of another offense in five years before seeking the job).  Employers should make sure that their written application forms and hiring policies comply with these restrictions or they could be subject to suit and enforcement proceedings."

1811339,"I suggest you contact an attorney to see if you met the criteria for filing a petition to modify your child support payments and have them lowered due to you unemployment.    Regarding the past due child support, your husband can file a motion for civil contempt for your failure to pay child support.  He would then have to set that motion for a hearing.  To be found in contempt, the court will have to determine if your failure to pay the support was willful and wanton, and if you had the ability to pay it.  Although courts do have the power to incarcerate you for failure to pay child support, they often will not resort to that for a first offense, especially if they don't find you in contempt. They may come up with another option first, such as paying a purge amount or distributing the past arrears over the next several months in addition to the current amount of child support.  However I would strongly suggest you speak to a lawyer about both the contempt issue and a modification, because if you qualify for a modification, and the court grants it, this can help prevent contempt issues in the future."

If he is younger, and they class him as an immediate relative (unmarried child under 21 - even if he is slightly over 21 - it depends on his age when the petition was filed) - then mum will probably get him here quickly.  You will file an I-129F for your fiancÌ©. You have to prove the bona-fides of the relationship, and when the petition is approved, he will get an interview at the embassy, and if all goes well, he will be able to come here on a K-1 visa, you can get married within 90 days of his arrival, and then he can apply to adjust his status. I say ""apply"" - because they will look closely at him to decide if he is admissible.  Alternatively you can get married abroad, and then either file for the K-3 to bring your spouse over and adjust, or file for him to come as your spouse and then do consular processing when it is approved.

After both parties to a lawsuit have had an opportunity to review evidence from both sides, a party can file a motion for summary judgment.

Since we all agree on the important facts, can you decide this dispute we are having on the law alone?""  The judge can agree that there are no ""genuine issues of material fact"" in dispute and rule on the motion (you may win, or you may lose), or may rule that there are genuine issues of material fact, and the case will go on.  The dates set are for the filing of the motions.  There is a date the motion will be filed by the party seeking to move for summary judgment, a date set for filing a motion in opposition to summary judgment (which your lawyer will do), and another date, maybe, for the moving party to file a reply brief.  Then you will wait for months, perhaps a year or maybe even more, for the judges decision."
1812643,"Forget the civil demand - they will not sue (although they will send more and more demanding letters - and then they will stop.)  It is a class C misdemeanor.

It should be included in the assets of the asset if a formal accounting is done, of course, but sometimes this does not happen.  What was your role in the estate?  If you have already signed off on an accounting by a personal representative, there may be nothing you can do, even about the funeral home bill.    If you have not signed off, then you may have some leverage, although the result of exercising it may be to reduce the amount available for distribution (by increasing attorneys' fees) and delay the ultimate distribution from the estate, if it has not already taken place."

He is just perpetrating the abuse to keep you trapped in a bad situation. It's a bad situation for you and your two daughters.   I understand your concern about not being able to pay for an attorney. It's certainly reasonable in your situation. However, that doesn't mean you are without options. There are legal aid organizations that assist people with divorce and you may have a better opportunity at qualifying for legal aid due your daughter's autism and the emotional abuse. Legal Aid of Northwest Texas should be your first phone call. If you do not qualify for legal aid then you should still talk to some lawyers in your area. You may be able to obtain a court order requiring your husband to pay your attorney fees and/or temporary support while the divorce is pending.   As an aside to the divorce, it sounds like revisiting the support obligation with the older daughter may be appropriate. It may be time to raise the monthly support amount and/or pursue enforcement of the medical support obligation so he is assisting with the medical bills."

You could file a police report or contact the DA's office; however, most prosecutors will only file perjury charges that are very easy to prove. For instance, if someone fails to disclose a criminal conviction on an application for welfare benefits, which clearly states  that is is signed under penalty of perjury, it is very easy to present the court documents that prove the person was convicted.

1803460,"First, a 5K is different from a Rule 35. A 5K is applied at sentencing, based on a defendant's cooperation to date.  If the government makes a motion under 5K1.1 of the sentencing guidelines, the judge can impose a sentence below the guidelines to reflect the value of the cooperation. If there is a mandatory minimum, the defendant needs a motion under 18 U.S.C. 3553(e) to give the judge authority to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum. These are issues that get negotiated as part of the plea.  Once sentence is imposed the judge has no authority to reduce the sentence under 5K1.1 or 3553(e).  However, if the defendant provides cooperation after sentencing, the prosecutor can bring a motion under Rule 35 to allow the judge to resentence the defendant to reflect the post-sentencing cooperation.  When this happens depends on when the cooperation is complete. The rule requires that the motion be brought within one year of sentencing unless the cooperation is based on information that was not known at the time of the first sentencing.  So, the answer depends on the nature and timing of the cooperation. But if the cooperation has been provided before sentencing, it should be reflected then with a 5k.  Finally, the defendant has a right to be present when being sentenced, so he would be brought back before the judge for a Rule 35 reduction."
1813064,"A good traffic ticket defense attorney would file a motion to dismiss the citations for lack of proper service.  The citation should be served in person for the Court to have jurisdiction over you.  In the past, your signature was required for service.  Recently, the statute was amended to allow for service of a citation without your having to sign it, however, the officer must certify that you were handed the tickets.  Failure to certify as such has led to a dismissal in many of my  client's cases.  The amendment does not mean that you can refuse to sign a citation at the request of an officer.  Failure to sign the citation at the request of an officer may lead to your arrest.  However, the officer may not just ""mail you a citation"", unless it is a Toll or Red Light Camera ticket, which are exempted.

1817873,"To add to the discussion, there is a capital gain tax matter you need to consider prior to having the property put in your name.  Others have mentioned the gift tax, but that really only matters when the donor has assets above 5 million dollars.  The capital gains tax is real and can be significant to you.  When your mother transfers the home to you while she is still alive, you take her tax basis in the property.  If you later sell the property you owe capital gain tax on the difference between her tax basis and the sales price.  Let's look at hypothetical numbers:  Mom and Dad bought the house in 1990 for $120,000.  When dad died the house was worth $180,000.  Mom's tax basis in the property is $150,000 (her 1/2 at $60,000 and Dad's 1/2 at $90,000).  If you sold the property immediately after her passing you would owe capital gains tax on the difference between her tax basis ($150,000) and whatever the property sold for.  However, if she held the property until her death and passed it to you under a will or trust, then you would be entitled to a step up in basis to the home's value at her date of death.  This can be a considerable tax savings to you.  Before you do anything, please consult with an attorney or your tax advisor!  Best of Luck!"

In today's world of a camera at near every corner, and many in between and everyone from age nine and up likely to be carrying a dang decent camera via a cell, being with folk on the QT is pretty much impossible unless one is dong so out in the wilderness.

1809597,"The uniform boating citation you received is for an infraction, not a crime.  Even if you are found guilty, you will not have a criminal record ‰ÛÓ just like a speeding ticket on the highway.  To fight the ticket, just follow the instructions on the back of your copy to request a hearing.  It might, however, be easier to simply pay the $50 civil penalty (plus court costs) by mail and chalk this one up to experience.  Based on what you wrote, you are guilty as charged.  Slow Speed Minimum Wake zones are boating restricted areas that the State of Florida has established to protect the public safety or manatees.  In Florida, only the state and federal authorities can regulate boat speed on the Intracoastal Waterway.  Within tight limitations, cities and counties can regulate vessel traffic on other waters within their respective jurisdictions.  Regardless of who created the restriction or where it is located, ""Slow Speed Minimum Wake"" is defined by rule in the Florida Administrative Code.  It means that a vessel must be fully off plane and completely settled into the water.  Once it is fully settled into the water, it must proceed at a speed that is reasonable and prudent under the existing circumstances to avoid creating an excessive wake or other hazardous condition.  Because you were operating on a plane, even minimally so, you were not proceeding at Slow Speed.  Even a vessel that is coming off plane and settling into the water or just beginning to come up onto plane is not proceeding at Slow Speed.  Even if a vessel is fully settled into the water, if it creates a wake that unreasonably or unnecessarily endangers other vessels, it is not proceeding at Slow Speed.  Only vessels that are completely off plane, fully settled into the water, and proceeding with a reasonable and prudent wake are proceeding at Slow Speed.  The officer was wrong about the 5 knots.  There is no numerical speed limit associated with the Slow Speed Minimum Wake restriction.  He may be saying that because hydrodynamic forces start to make very small vessels rise in the water column at around 5 knots.  Larger planing hull vessels start to rise in the water column at between 7 and 10 knots, depending on their size and hull configuration.  Displacement hull vessels are always fully settled into the water, no matter what their speed of operation ‰ÛÓ for such a vessel, the question is whether or not its wake is reasonable and prudent to avoid endangering other vessels (including vessels at anchor or moored along the shore).  If you decide to retain an attorney to fight this citation, I suggest you choose one who is thoroughly knowledgeable and experienced in Maritime Law and can give you specific legal advice based on the particular facts and circumstances of your case.

1885411,"You are not going to find any lawyers with Dyck O'neal experience.  For the same reason that prior to the 2008 meltdown, outside of legal aid offices there were not lawyers defending foreclosure actions.  In 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the most part sat on their hands and were not pursuing deficiency claims in Florida.  Then the Florida Legislature amended the statute of limitations with respect to deficiency claims, which imposed a July 1, 2014 deadline to file the claims that were more than a year old.   In the two months before the July 1, 2014 deadline Dyck O'neal using the Consuegra firm filed approximately 10,000 of these cases across the state.  All of the cases are brand new.  Some lawyers have handled other deficiency claims but the Dyck cases are brand new.  Nobody has more than two months experience with these cases because until June of 2014 they did not exist.  You will either find somebody who will tell you what you want to hear, but likely exaggerate their experience or somebody who will tell it to you straight.     What you really need is a lawyer with a proven track record defending consumers in consumer litigation matters (which includes but is not limited to Foreclosure cases) in the Space Coast who will offer you a fee structure that makes financial sense.  We do these cases on a partial reverse contingency where the amount of our fee is primarily determined by how much we save the consumer.

However, the bad news is Applications and Petitions must be filed for each child and the fees must be paid. Marrying within 60 days of Mom entering the country will raise a red flag that Mom entered the country on a Non Immigrant Visa  and Immigrant Intent. This can lead to a charge of fraud. Also, for the children to remain in the USA or to Adjust Status may require official approval from their other parent - depending on the circumstances."

This is a very common occurrence that people want to change the visitation and/or custody arrangements. Most people call this ""taking someone back to court for custody.""

1815804,"Strictly speaking, it is the ""contents"" of the safe deposit box that ""may"" be fair game. A creditor with a judgment could obtain a write of attachment for the contents of a safe deposit box. At which point, the debtor would need to go to court (the court that issued the garnishment ) and claim an exemption if an exemption would apply to the contents. If no exemption applies, then the contents are turned over to the creditor.   However, I am with Robert...just deal with the ""REAL"" problem, resolve the debt. Pay it, settle it, declare bankruptcy. Living this cat and mouse game and living a life of creditor avoidance is no way to live. I am guessing your life wasn't always like this.   Lastly, the ""reality on the street"" is that safe deposit boxes are rarely hit by creditors. Two main reasons why (1) few people have them, and (2) those that do generally only keep important documents in them. The rest of the people who have safe deposit boxes are either wealthy, spies, or white collar criminals :)"
1788304,"If father will come into court and say he did drive the kids at 110, great.  But I doubt he will say that in court.  So, you need to set a mediation date where the kids can say that it happened (IF the kids will say it; because it is hard and painful for a child to be forced to say a bad thing about their parent.)    Assuming the kids do report it to the mediator, and the mediator reports it to the judge, then it is up to a judge.   I have 23 years of family law experience and  I know you want me to say the judge will transfer custody to you.   But, my guess is a judge would not transfer custody, based on that one incident, but the judge would instead  chasten the father in court and warn father that custody might be transferred if there are future, similar, incidents."

1794625,"In Los Angeles, demurrers are common as a method to extend the eviction process. They are typically set 35 to 40 days out as there is no specific provision within the Civil Code that would speed up the hearing in an unlawful detainer setting.

Without the ex parte application, you will be stuck with what I would assume to be an August hearing date"
1822855,"You received good advice from the attorneys that responded to your question.  With regard to the release, at least in Pennsylvania the court must approve a settlement for a minor --which typically is a formality--and the money must be placed in a restricted, interest bearing, insured account until the minor is 18.  If the same is true in CA then that is what should be done--no reason to wait until your son is 18 so he can sign the release--interest may not be a lot but why let the insurance company benefit from your son's money. If the policy limits are $15K and there are no other possible ""defendants"" and the person responsible has no ""real"" assets then $15K is obviously the most your son can recover.  However, if they are offering the policy limits then the value of the claim exceeds the policy limits.  There may be another source to compensate your son for his injuries.  You may have underinsurance coverage on your auto policy.  Underinsurance provides benefits to you--covered individuals--which may inclued your son if the person who causes the injury does not have enough insurance to cover the claim.  If you have it, you bought it to protect your family for just this circumstance.  Use it.  Check your DEC sheet to see if you purchased it--in your states--I think most states--it is not mandatory and if you have it, you paid for it.    My suggestion is to contact a personal injury lawyer near you and pay for an hour of that lawyer's time to review the settlement/release, review ""your"" policy, review the potential for any other additional claims than can be brought.  In this way you can feel comfortable that you did everything you could to protect your child."
1983153,"I'm interested to know whether you were interviewed by either the police, or by a store personnel, about this matter.  Any statements you may have made to the police or the store personnel will  most likely be used against you in court.  If you have not been interviewed yet, you should NOT answer ANY of their questions.  Instead, say you need a lawyer present in order to speak with them.  Embezzlement of less than $200 is a misdemeanor in this Commonwealth.  The maximum penalty is 1 year in jail.  If you have no criminal record, it is unlikely you will have to serve any jail time, if you are found guilty of this offense.  However, you need an attorney to carefully consider whether they even have evidence to convict you.  Additionally, even if they can prove there case, there are other ways of resolving the case that can save you from having an embezzlement conviction.  A theft/embezzlement/fraud conviction is one of the worst possible things to have on your record, and can affect your life, including employability, for years to come.  Please consult with a northern Virginia lawyer as soon as possible about your situation."
1822663,"If you waived time, you waived your speedy trial rights.  You could pull your waiver and start the speedy trial clock starting again.  But, that might not be the best idea if your attorney doesn't believe he is ready to put on a defense, yet.  If your public defender questioned your competence to stand trial and you were subsequently found competent, I would argue that the public defender's office now has a conflict of interest in that it cannot give you zealous representation if it does not believe you are competent.   The conflict defender or whatever office they have in Santa Clara county to handle indigent cases when the public defender has a conflict (and, they most certainly have one) should be appointed.  Tell the judge you do not believe the public defender can adequately represent you as they have already declared a doubt about your mental competency and ask for conflict counsel to be appointed.

1791113,"You should speak with a Texas attorney. The laws of each state are different. Since your mother passed in Texas, Texas law governs. That state may have a similar process as we have here for small estates, which is to provide an affidavit of small estate to confirm you are the successor and no probate is or will be pending for your mother's estate. Good Luck."
1791562,"1)  No. No need for any additional ""stamping"" since you already have an H-1 visa which is still valid.  2)  No, you don't, since employer will simply be filing for the extension of your status in the US and you will be able to continue working for that employer without having to leave the country. You will need ""fresh"" stamping once you travel back to Hindustan AND your current visa stamp has expired or is about to expire. Not before.  3)  No, you don't, for the reasons explained in number 1 and 2 above. the H-1B is a ""dual intent' visa, the filing of a ""green card"" application (PERM, I-140 & I-485) will thus not impede the extension of your visa at any time during those 3 processes listed above."

1810096,"Most large companies now use nationwide background check companies that will find a prior conviction, even for a misdemeanor offense.  The best advice is typically to disclose such prior offenses, as an employer will likely look even less favorably on someone caught being dishonest than someone who is candid about the prior offense.  An interviewee with such an issue should also prepare an explanation of the offense, and of any efforts at rehabilitation and moving forward, so as to be ready to answer questions in a positive way.  For some (but certainly not all offenses), it may be possible to seek expungement of the prior offense, so it may also be worth consulting with a lawyer in the jurisdiction of conviction to determine whether that is an option in a specific case.  Many people have successfully overcome prior convictions to find employment and otherwise move on with their lives, so no one in this position should lose hope."
1796520,"If he is innocent, there can be no plea, which may have factored into why there had to be a trial. Once the jury has returned a verdict, there is no plea bargaining. After sentencing he can either file an appeal ((which has to be filed within 45 days) or he can file for post-conviction relief. If he wants to change lawyers he can, with the permission of the court. If you want a second opinion of what has occurred, you would need to have an experienced criminal trial atty look at the complete file."
1796004,"If the Will specifically grants the Personal Representative the authority to sell real property, petitioning the court for approval of the sale is not necessary.  The daughter will need to petition the Court for appointment and have her Certificate of Appointment in hand before she can sign any closing documents.  If she is under a time crunch, I would recommend consulting an experienced probate attorney in the area to insure things are handled quickly and correctly."
2539884,"I am sorry that you are ill.  But as to your legal question, you have a two year statute of limitations (CCP 335.1)  to sue the landlord from when you incurred the damages which in your case, is probably about just before the unlawful detainer action was filed.  Statute of limitations is very important to have a lawyer sit down with you and analyze.  I strongly suggest you hire a personal injury attorney also familiar with landlord tenant issues for your case."
1814908,"It varies from Will to Will, but in your case, it sounds like the real estate would be covered by the residuary clause.

1907236,"I agree with my colleagues.  Your husband should definitely speak with a local attorney.  There are important questions which will determine the outcome of the case.  Was your husband charged with a no-valid license?  Any injuries?  Was he charged with leaving the scene of an accident?  What is his history?    Incidentally, you should also speak with an immigration attorney to see if there is anything to be done about your husband's status.  Good luck."
1823505,"They should not be able to readily find this information anywhere. Unless you have reason to believe your ex-employer is improperly talking to potential new employers about your FMLA leave, it is highly doubtful they had other means to get this information. I agree with the above attorney that you cannot be discriminated against simply due to your requirement for FMLA leave. If you have more specific questions I would recommend seeking a consultation with an employment attorney in your area. This website has a great ""Find a Lawyer"" tool if you do not know of any. Best of luck to you!"
1802764,"First you need to read 17 USC 105 which prohibits copyright for such works by Government employees. That limits your power to enforce any exclusivity.  But, receiving awards and honorariums is not problematic. Official do it frequently. Even legislators take honorariums. It's an accepted form of graft and corruption.  As to your specific 4 questions, here is my take: 1. Could I enter the composition into a competition that has a monetary prize, and legally accept the prize if I won? Yes. 2. Could I perform the piece with civilians at a concert, making money from the ticket sales? Yes, if structured properly as reimbursement of expenses. 3. Could I record the piece and sell CD's? Yes, but anyone could copy any Government version and sell in competition with you. Whether you could get a copyright on your personal sound recordings of a public domain work depends on a more complex analysis beyond the scope here. See a copyright attorney to have this structured to mitigate risk and enhance copyright protection, if any, available to you. 4. Could I sell the score and parts to schools for them to perform? NO. You should not do that as the score and parts thereof are public domain, UNLESS you work closely with an IP attorney to make the items you sell have significant original content not produced in your capacity as a Government employee. And, even then, you need to check with the General Counsel (or the GC's delegee) as to the Government's position on this, as you don't want to get disciplined  for violation of some Government agency policy."

1800734,"Under Oklahoma law, a judge need not sign a subpoena in order for it to be valid. In a criminal case, both the state and the defense may have subpoenas issued by the court clerk (see 22 O.S. å¤ 701 et seq.). Similarly, attorneys can have subpoenas issued by the clerk of the court in civil matters (see 12 O.S. å¤ 2004.1).  If you feel that you have a legal defense to complying with a subpoena, you can have the subpoena judicially reviewed. You will need an attorney to assist you with challenging a subpoena."

1817024,"You obviously have a complicated claim.  IT is normal for an LTD carrier to request that you apply for social security disability and, if you don't, decrease your benefits.  As for home health care there are recently laws and an important en banc workers compensation appeals board that addresses your home health care issue.  In short, you need a prescription from your doctor(s) for the workers compensation carrier to have any liability for this.  Here is a link to the case.    I would recommend that you meet an attorney for a free consultation.  There are many of us in your area you would be happy to meet with you and go over your issues in detail."
1811132,"The default answer is the applicable SOL will be the state where you reside when you are sued. For ""planning purposes"" that is what you use. However, the legal answer can be far more complex and is beyond the scope of this forum (books and articles are written on the subject). The note may have a provision for the SOL, and when you are sued, your state's laws will have a say on which SOL to apply. The more relevant question is when does the SOL clock start to tick. I do student loan law for a living, every debtor I have ever consulted with on this issue (private student loans and SOL) got it wrong as to when they ""thought"" the SOL would expire. The main problem with private student loans are the voluntary forbearance and deferments you may have used. The SOL clock is not ticking when you have any sort of forbearance or deferment in place.   Lastly, keep in mind, SOL is hollow victory. If the SOL expires, the debt doesn't go way. All the SOL gives you is a defense to a lawsuit. You can still be sued after the expiration of the SOL, and unless you appear to raise the SOL as a defense, they can still get a judgment against you. They can still call and send letters demanding payment, etc.   Bottom line, you borrowed $150,000 and haven't paid it back. That is not going to go away on it own."

1823315,"As a general matter, the upside of a bankruptcy is that it provides you with a relatively clean start.  In a Chapter 7, most of your debts will be discharged (meaning you will no longer have any legal obligation to repay them) and you will have to surrender all of your non-exempt assets.  You will need to speak with a lawyer to determine if you have any non-exempt assets.  Once your discharge is granted, your credit score will begin to rebound remarkably fast.  In a Chapter 13, the process is a little different.  You will not have to surrender any assets, but you will be required to make a payment (to be determined by a formula) for 3 - 5 years before you are granted a discharge."
1827926,You should retain a workers compensation attorney.   A full consultation would be necessary to properly advise you.
1818571,"the parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by agreement. so no, you cannot consent to il juris.   you say you cannot afford counsel but this is getting pretty complex to handle without counsel. you should get il counsel to do a motion in her case here to determine that il is not the home state. but you should file in tx now also."
1829027,"Yes, you could be charged with uttering a bad or stolen check for each of the stolen checks deposited.  Your uncle didn't do you any favors as this is one of the oldest scams run at the banks.  You should never cash or deposit a check for someone.  Ask yourself why they aren't doing it.  Also, since the checks were stolen, they probably didn't have your uncle's name and that gives you some notice that things are not on the up and up.   If you are contacted by the police, you should NOT make any statements without first consulting an experienced criminal defense attorney.  I take it since you now know they were stolen that the bank has contacted you.  They will also file a police report...."
1818931,"You have two options, you can file a lien or commence a breach of contract lawsuit. Even if you pursue the latter option, you may want to file a lien first and assert a cause of action for lien foreclosure. If the amount in dispute is large enough (>$20k), filing a lawsuit may be justified. If not, filing a lien is relatively simple and inexpensive, and you could always prosecute a claim in small claims court for breach of contract if the contractor just files a bond to discharge the lien pursuant to Lien Law 19(4) rather than paying you."
1827798,"Presumably your daughter has insurance on the car. Unless the driver was specifically excluded from her policy, the fact that he did not have insurance is probably irrelevant, since your daughter's insurance policy will provide primary coverage.   If the driver was at fault, your daughter is also individually liable as the car's owner. But that liability for bodily injury is capped at $15,000. If she is found to have negligently entrusted the vehicle to the driver (for example, if she knew or should have known that he had been drinking), her liability is not limited by statute.  The best thing to do is to promptly report this loss to your daughter's insurance company. They will indemnify and defend her and the driver."
1811187,"The prudent, realistic assumption is that everyone involved - i.e., your and your friend - and their respective insurers will be responsible financially.  The parties would send copies of all relevant documentation to all of the insurers, who would work out their respective amounts of financial responsibility as well as the financial responsibility of their respective insureds (e.g., for deductible amounts).  As my colleague noted, your insurance agent can discuss the circumstances under which there would be a resulting premium increase."
1827930,"As an injured victim, you are entitled to a variety of damages under the law, including all medical expenses incurred due to the injury, lost wages, pains and suffering, and loss of normal life. The amount of damages you are entitled to will depend on the nature and extent of your injuries. And there's no way to know that until you have completed your medical treatment and have recovered as much as possible to your pre-accident condition.  No one can speculate as to your damages one week after the accident when you still have a lot of pain. The insurance company for the other driver is going to low ball you and do what they try to do with every claim pay as little as possible. You need to hire an attorney to help you get maximum compensation. With your type of injuries, it's not appropriate to handle this on your own and battle a large insurance company.  Most attorneys in this area offer free consultation and you should hire an attorney you feel comfortable with.   Insurance companies usually don't make more than one payment to an injured party and only after everyone agrees on an amount.   Until that time, they may make payments to your medical providers if you authorize such payments.  I wish you a speedy recovery and that you get the compensation you deserve."
1805407,I agree with the answer provided by Ms Evans. The sad part of all of this (besides the tragic deaths) is that apparently no estate planning was done in advance. This family is going through the nightmare of two different probate proceedings which could have been avoided with living trusts.

1796133,"You can have an I-130 filed on your behalf.  However, that doesn't change your ground of inadmissibility you will probably have to seek post conviction relief on that criminal charge to see if you can get the case reopened and dismissed or reduced so that you aren't inadmissible.  Also,  there may be a citizenship opportunity but we would need to see all your documentation."
1815751,"You can't sue for negligence because the Fair Credit Reporting Act preempts state law relating to credit reporting.  If you had disputed their tradeline with the credit bureaus, and they failed to correct it, you could have sued them under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, assuming the statute of limitations did not expire.  Unfortunately, a lot of people do not realize they need to send a dispute to the credit bureaus in order to preserve their rights in this type of situation.  If you did not send a dispute, the other possible claim you could have would be under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  The FDCPA has a shorter statute of limitations (one year, as opposed to 2 for the FCRA).    If you had some proof they knew the bill had been paid, and they did not correct their reporting, you might have a decent FDCPA claim, but the problem is you are not likely to have that proof if you never informed them of the error (and it sounds like they did correct things once you did tell them).   Consult a consumer law attorney to discuss all of the facts, to get a more precise answer."
1812445,"Unfortunately you got ""played"" by your employer.  I see this almost every day when employers (not police) tell you something you want to hear and then after getting you to ""confess"", call the police. You see, without your confession, these type of crimes are defensible and in many cases hard to prove. With your confession, the Police can tie in certain types of evidence and connect you to the crime. You need to meet with a lawyer asap as the police will likely file charges with the State. Ultimately a warrant will be issued for your arrest. You need to lawyer up and start preparing a defense."
1248260,"If there is a warrant, then you may experience difficulty entering the U.S. But as my colleagues have pointed out, you should consult an immigration attorney as well.

1808516,"Noncompetition agreements are always illegal in California. That is to say, you can never be prevented from working for anyone, even a direct competitor of your previous employer.  Nonsolicitation agreements -- that is, agreements that prevent you from soliciting your former employer's clients -- are also usually illegal. This is a special area of interest of mine, as my first published case, Thompson v. Impaxx, Inc., addressed this very matter.  You are free to take your former employer's client's away, even to solicit them, so long as you do not use trade secrets in doing so. Contrary to what some of my colleagues have said, client lists are rarely trade secrets. It is usually pretty easy to establish that they are not, but you will want to get on top of this quickly.  A significant point is the location of your previous employer and whether your contract had a choice-of-law provision. A choice-of-law provision provides that some other state's law will apply instead of California's. If you had such a provision, then what I've said here may not apply, and you will want to be examine your contract very closely to determine your next steps.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Sincerely, Craig T. Byrnes"

The attorney can help document injuries and losses and insure that you get the compensation you deserve.  A lawyer can also help with the property damage and making a PIP claim to cover your medical bills and lost wages assuming that you did not waive the coverage.  An attorney can make sure that liens get paid.  You should not speak with the insurance company for the other driver, but instead have an attorney handle that.  Make sure you receive treatment for your injuries so that you feel better soon."

1829942,"One month to respond to a local CIS office's documents request RFE, while customary nowadays, can nevertheless be too short, as can be seen in your particular situation. Usually USCIS will agree to extend the deadline for ""good cause"" shown. You'll need to write a compelling letter explaining why the extension should be granted. Better yet, have your criminal defense lawyer write that letter - the extension will be granted."
1782457,"What everyone is saying is fine.  Legal objections are proper, and objections to the ""form"" of the question are waived unless made at the eposition.  That means that if you don't understand the question, the witness might not understand it either, in which case an objection based on ""vague and ambiguous"" is proper, if not required to preserve the same objection to the time of trial.  Likewise, many lawyers like to ask ""argumentative"" questions.  An ""argumentative"" question is one not being asked to obtain information from the witness, but rather is deliberately calculated by the questioner to make some key point in his or her case, that is damaging or embarasing to your case or to the witness.  (e.g., ""isn't it a fact that you no longer beat your wife?"")  Its ""argumentative because  no matter if the witness answers ""yes"" or ""no"" the net result is the same-- he did beat his wife at some point in the past.  The next question will be ""when, did you stop?""   Hence, the proper objection is ""argumentative"".    What I do, and most other competent lawyers would do in the case of a ""friendly"" witness (such as your former business partner (presuming you're still on good terms),, is to interview the witness first (before the  deposition) and find out what he's going to say at the deposition to the ""key"" questions, or ""sensitive"" issues.  That way you will not have to constantly object at the deposition itself, if you already know what the answer is going to be, and it is favorable.  If you don't know what the answer is, or if you know the answer could be unfavorable, you might put in a ""vague and ambiguous"" objection to make the questioner clarify his or her question, which may have the effect of deflecting the question away from the potential ""bad"" testimony.    In fact, my ususal practice is to not object at the deposition unless i don't understand the question, or think the manner in which it is asked will lead to a ""bad"" answer.  Defending depositions is an ""art"", it comes only with experience.  But everybody has to start someplace.  In my earlier years, my rule of thumb was ""when in doubt, keep it out""  (that means if you don't know, object.  It's a lot easier to make the objection and preserve the issue for trial, then to keep quiet, and risk a subsequent ruling that  you waived the objection by not making it at the deposition.  Hope this helps. Good luck."

Once the I-751 is accepted, you will receive a letter extending the conditional status for up to one year while the petition is processed.  If your wife received her green card in September 2013, it should not expire for two years -- the two years is not based on the date of your marriage but the date the green card was issued.  If you have concerns or the green card is about to expire soon you should consult with an immigration attorney who can guide you through the process of maintaining permanent resident status -- Don't lose it!"

1823435,"First, you should be aware that charges could be filed against you whether you speak with the police or not.  Your friend's statement that you were with him COULD be enough to support a charge of trespassing (possibly theft, if the police believe you took part in helping him remove items).  If you speak with the police and confirm that you were there, that could be used against you as a confession to having ""trespassed"".  On the other hand, you certainly would not want to lie to the police and claim you were not present, as that would open you up to possible obstruction charges if they could definitively prove that you were there and lied about not being there.  The best bet would be to either decline to speak with them or to hire an attorney prior to speaking with them.  An attorney could try to arrange for you to share your details of what happened, without that information being used against you.  It would be best for you to not answer any questions without having an attorney on your side.  If you need additional time to obtain an attorney, you could politely advise the investigating officer that you are willing to speak with them but only after you have counsel with you.  That would hopefully keep them from moving forward with charges against you until after you and your attorney could arrange for some kind of agreement.  In the end, however, YOU have no requirement to speak with them, but THEY do not have any requirement to hold off on filing charges.  Just be very careful if you choose to speak with them without an attorney, as they could possibly (1) record the conversation, (2) report your statements inaccurately, and/or (3) use any number of tricks to try and get you to admit to something that could be used against you.    Without a confession from you, the only evidence that they would have is (a) the picture from the school, and (b) your friend's statement.  They could only use your friend's statement if he actually agreed to testify for the State in Court.  Otherwise, that is hearsay and the picture alone may not be enough to prove it was you.  Just some things to ponder."

You will have to apply for an F-1 visa from your home country and then can enter in that status.  If you are not subject to the 2 year home residency requirement then you can apply to change status within the USA itself.

Yes, you should report any work to the SSA, since they will definitely learn of it later from the IRS.  But remember, a denial prior to ALJ hearing is just appealed to the next step, no big deal.

1787929,"Your green card is like a passport - just because it expires does not make the status disappear or expire - you just can't USE it. You stated you are in the US. So, if you have been living in the US this whole time and just have an expired green card, you should renew it. And think about applying for citizenship too. Your status as a green card holder does not expire with the green card so you would not be out of status for the past 10 + years nor would you acquire unlawful presence. Think about making an appointment with an immigration attorney to discuss your situation, especially any criminal issues.   Boston and Framingham Locations"

If the sheriff has not yet showed up to post the writ, you have at least three judicial days before the sheriff can return to execute the writ. Sheriff's deputies are busy and have challenging schedules. The risk is that if you sit back and think, ""they won't get here before the 24th"" - they COULD. Then all your stuff would be locked up or disbursed to the winds.   If you have a lease that has not by its terms expired, you have FIVE judicial days. See RCW 59 18 410. But if you don't contact the sheriff and point this out, they have no way to know this.   Elizabeth Powell"

There is a mandatory requirement that cases filed must be dismissed after five (5) years unless there are existing orders that deal with children of the parties. You are presently in Santa Ana, but the website you go to must be in the county the divorce was filed. I have provided links for you to Orange County's website  and Los Angeles County's website.

An employer can initiate employment employment-based green card proceedings on your behalf, but that can take 4 years or more to complete.

An employer can make an employee do any lawful act, no matter how disgusting.  Your friend should make contact with Cal-OSHA to determine if cleaning up vomit with bare hands is a violation of one of its regulations and if so, the employee can refuse to do so in the future.  There is no cause of action the employee can bring for such a violation unless there is an adverse employment action triggered by such a violation.  In other words, if asked to do it again and she refuses and gets fired, she MIGHT have a claim.  If she gets sick, she has a workers compensation claim - that's it.  Good luck to you, and to her."

Can't speak to the false accusation,but nothing in your post indicates a false arrest (even if you had been found 'not guilty' at trial, you would have no per se false arrest grounds) or malicious prosecution which requires intentionally prosecuting without any probable cause.  That said, you left out a lot of facts (understandable).   Pleading instead of turning it over to a criminal defense attorney and the trial process may have seemed a good choice at the time (avoiding the uncertainty of trial), but it comes with its own downside.  For example, in my own state, there is no possibility of expunging the record--the conviction stays on record forever on a plea, just like a conviction.  Your state is NOT the same as mys state as I recall, you should check into possible expungment of the record."

1829035,"Although I agree with both answers already submitted, I might offer some additional information.  First of all, all Alabama Courts are monitored by AOC (Administrative Office of the Courts).  This Administrative function is based in Montgomery and primarily exists to handle the Court's affairs in all 67 Counties.  Your case was actually tried I'm assuming in Houston County Circuit Court.  All Alabama Judges are familiar with the term ""time standards"".  That term is used by AOC to keep a finger on the pulse of each pending action in Alabama for the purpose of grading the efficiency of case management (movement), and in actuality the efficiency of each Judge.  Most Judges would like to get cases off of their working Dockets and ; therefore, enter Final Orders when cases are over.  Sometimes when an unusual delay occurs, you may need to ""respectfully remind"" the Court that an Order needs to be entered.  In many cases, a Final Order is necessary to satisfy financial obligations or convey real or personal property.  If you have fulfilled your retainer obligation with your trial attorney, a simple phone call requesting that a motion to to enter Final Divorce Decree be filed with the Circuit Clerk.  If that doesn't work, you can always call or visit the Circuit Clerk's office at the Courthouse and speak with the person who handle the domestic relations case load.  That person might ask you to sign a motion asking the Judge to enter an Order or simply pull and flag the case for the Judge to see an Order has not yet be entered.  Be mindful if you file anything on your own (pro se) that Alabama Rules Of Civil Procedure require you to copy the opposing counsel by signing a certificate of service and mailing the copy to him/her.  The clerk will be able to help you with this as it is a very simple process.  I hope this helps you resolve this issue.   Trey Norman"

The litigation will take the better part of a year, if fully played out.  By that time your youngest will be almost 18, and no longer a minor.  At this point you would have to file a Petition for Modification and plead that the circumstances at present were materially different than at the time of the Final Judgment.

Hence, the suggestion you consult with an attorney.  Of course, if the father's rights are not legally established, his parents rights are also not legally established.

1812561,"Q: Why do I have to designate one of us as the custodial parent when custody is clearly shared? A: The court normally requires this designation, even in a 50-50 parenting plan. However, I have seen some Commissioners say in that paragraph ""Both parties shall be designated as the custodian ..."" Q: Would one of us lose rights/privileges if one of us is named as a non-custodial parent? A: Normally it does not seem to impact rights; but if a later motion is filed, there is often some advantage to having been identified as the custodial parent. Q: Does it really matter who is named if custody is already shared at 50-50? A: See the previous comment. Q: Is the Federal reference in regards to the filing of our taxes?

A trademark is a method of identifying and distinguishing your protect from all others out there.   2. Can the Trade mark be on my name since i have a signed agreement with the manufacturer for exclusive distribution in the US?   If you are the one producing the product or service here in the United States, yes, you own the rights to the trademark.  3. Is obtaining a Trade mark enough for potential investors?   The question is a little vague, but most potential investors are going to be very worried if the product can be made and sold by competitors, especially if it is in the start-up period. A trademark is not going to exclude competitors the way a patent can.  It is very much in your interest to discuss this in greater detail with an intellectual property lawyer in the Los Angeles area. Avvo's ""Find a Lawyer"" tab above can be very helpful."
1797723,"I agree with the other two attorneys who responded before me. If in the POA, one of your powers is to conduct transfers of real property (that is typical in most financial POAs), then you should be able to have the current occupants removed so long as the owner of the property (the person on whose behalf you are acting) would have the power to do so. So, for example, if the current occupants have a valid rental contract on the property, they are timely in making their payments and have not breached the contract, you may not be able to have them evicted. However, if they are squatters, you most likely would be able to have them removed. I agree that you should contact an attorney to help you understand the powers you hold and any other legal rights.

To avoid the probation violation and the shoplifting charge, you need to win on the shoplifting charge.  Hire an attorney who regularly appears in the court at issue and who has at least ten years of experience.  Do not hire an attorney who simply will listen to you and sympathize with you.

If there's a Will, the executor of your husband's estate should be able to convey the property to you.  With respect to the one with the mortgage, I'm not sure why you would want the mortgage in your name.  You are probably be better off just paying the mortgage and having personal liability for the debt.

1817129,"It is truly not possible to evaluate a specific case or sentence in a general discussion forum,as an attorney would need to review the specific judgment, sentence, revocation petition and hearing, and more, to determine exactly what occurred and (for example) what jail credit may be denied or applied in a specific case. A defendant who believes a probation revocation or sentence was improper or excessive does have a right to appeal, but there are strict deadlines for such an appeal, and the best advice would be to immediately request that the attorney who handled the revocation file a notice of appeal, or to quickly retain a lawyer to file such notice. Courts have wide discretion over probation revocations, and many such appeals are unsuccessful, but there may be hope in a specific case. Probationers are typically not given jail credit for time spent in the community while on probation, but may receive credit for time spent in custody on a sentence that is later revoked.  It will depend on the circumstances, which are difficult to evaluate in a public forum. Good luck to anyone in this difficult situation."

1809251,"Leishmaniasis is a disease that once was relegated to impoverished third world countries, but it is now being seen in the US. Both humans and dogs are reservoirs for the disease and the sandfly is the vector that transmits the parasite to a new host. In order to prove negligence, typically a plaintiff must show a duty owed. Here, it's reasonable to conclude that an apartment complex owes you a duty to provide reasonable pest control. Second, a plaintiff must show a breach in such a duty (perhaps you can) and then yolk the breach in a causal relationship to the damages claimed (here the acquisition of Leishmaniasis). The achilles heel of your case is causation. Since soldiers returning from the middle east reside in your complex, a reservoir may exist. What level of pest control could have prevented this transmission? A potential case will pivot on this point.

One thing I greatly wish was that I'd gotten more real-world experience before going into law school.  30 is not that old, I assure you.  If I were in your shoes, I'd continue with the dream of becoming a detective.  Work at that for a few years and you'll get hundreds of courtroom appearances and backstage exposure to what judges and DAs do and how it all really works.  That kind of experience is worth way more than whatever time you may think you have wasted.  Trust me on that one.  The one thing that most law students nowadays utterly lack is real world experience, and if you're close to getting a police or detective job, I'd seriously not waste that opportunity to live a little.  It would more than pay off down the road, if you ever did decide to become a lawyer."
1819485,"Virginia will not expunge convictions. Your only options to overturn these convictions would be either a Writ of Coram Nobis or a Wirt of Habeas Corpus. For a Writ of Coram Nobis, there must be an error in fact or an error in the record which, in your case, led to the conviction. Generally, a Writ of Coram Nobis is limited to a narrow set of circumstances. A Writ of Habeas Corpus is designed to challenge the validity of a detention. Unfortunately, neither of these tools will likely to be available to you in this matter. Furthermore, Virginia treats a third offense of a violation of a protective order as a Class 6 felony .

Obviously, once any portion is paid by any of you, the debt is reduced.  I would recommend that you pay your $500 as soon as you can and then seek advice from your attorney or your probation officer as to whether the court would consider releasing you from further responsibility.  It is possible that the court might do just that, but probable that they won't.  If you pay the full $1500, you can sue the other two defendants in small claims court to recover the $500 each that they should have pitched in.  Good luck."

Assuming he came in from Canada through a checkpoint, and not secretly across the northern border (do they have coyotes up there?)  then he is eligible for adjustment. My advice to people is you choose how to live your life, who you want to be with and what your personal commitments are, and then deal with immigration. Even for people who are being removed, the world is a big place, and what matters isn't what the paperwork says - it's how you want to live your lives."
1796410,You questions includes many statements of fact that may conflict with other facts.  It is possible the property is in your name and the title company is just being cautions.  It is also possible that a step was missed that is not obvious to you on the face of the matter.  Schedule an appointment with a probate attorney.  They will be able to help you review the matter and come up with a solution.
1829670,"In general, the statute of limitations on collecting unpaid taxes is 10 years.  Your installment payment plan should have been structured to make sure the full amount is paid before that time.  If you die before that 10-year period ends the tax debt will still be a valid debt against your estate and will have to be paid from the assets of your estate.  The statute of limitations on the FBAR penalties is a little more complicated.  Under the law, the government has 2 years from the time the FBAR penalty is assessed to file suit in court to collect the penalty through a judgment.  If judgment is given against you, then the government has basically twenty years to collect under that judgment.  Again, if the judgment is still outstanding when you pass away, it will be a debt against your estate that must be paid from the estate's assets.  It will only be your estate that would have to pay these amounts.  While that would reduce the inheritance your children would receive, they would not have to pay out of their own pockets if the assets in your estate were not enough to pay them off."

1813672,"Generally, as noted by the other fine attorneys, your ""remedy"" would be getting out from under the lease. Essentially, they could call this a forced eviction and you would be entitled to your money back, lease cancellation and perhaps some $$ for relocation AND if you can prove it, loss of income. This is not the kind of case that could be like winning the lottery. Get yourself a LL/TNT attorney asap and hope that there is an attorney fee clause in your lease. Otherwise, it may cost you more to bring the case than you may ever hope to collect."
1809512,"Depending on his crimes, it shouldn't be a problem. If they are sex related crimes, then it may be an issue. Also, some drug sales convictions are less likely but raise concerns with financial support. If the crimes awe not of those nature, it should be okay but he should deal with the warrant. You also should consider hiring an attorney to assist."

1797937,"Consult immediately with an experienced criminal defense lawyer in regards to the tickets, as several of your issues (in particular the unlicensed and uninsured) are likely to have a significant impact in whether a court will agree to let your attorney appear without you, and what the consequences will be if you were to be convicted or plead guilty. In addition, consult with an experienced immigration attorney to see what can be done to address the 'illegal' status. Many judges will view the combination (illegal status) and the failure to abide by the laws (unregistered, uninsured, unlicensed) as an aggravating factor. In many cases where the client is not illegal, I would expect to resolve these types of summonses with a fine...maybe without you appearing...but your illegal status complicates this case. Have the consultations BEFORE your court date so you can make a decision as to how to resolve this matter."
1800636,"Some administrative proceedings can take a long time to process internally before lawyers become involved.  If you have received a notice of rights along with your letter of denial, pay close attention to any and all deadlines included therein.

1814942,"There are many in Florida. Just Google it and you will find one. Under AVVO guidelines we cannot recommend or help solicit a person or business.  There are a couple of good ones in the Miami area and Orlando. The fees are reasonable. However, where it gets expensive is when you need to have the forensic analyst testify in court.  You will not be able to testify about it on your own, but will need the analyst to testify and you may have to qualify them as an expert prior to being able to admit the analyzed DVD or any forensic evidence obtained from the DVD.  You will have to pay for their travel time, time waiting to testify, and time spent testifying.   From a practical stand point, unless this is a felony DUI it is rarely financially practical to have this done. I generally use these analysts in serious cases where the alleged crime has been caught on surveillance camera such as convenience store robberies or homicides."

The sponsor agrees to provide support to maintain the sponsored alien at an annual income that is not less than 125% of the Federal Poverty guideline during the period in which the affidavit is enforceable. The contract states that as the sponsor your obligation will continue until your death or the sponsored immigrant(s) have become U.S. citizens, depart the US permanently or die.

1964215,Yes. You can appeal the ruling to the court of appeals or you can come back to the same court and file a motion to modify the custody arrangement based on the best interests of the children.

1814374,"You have a number of issue mixed up in this paragraph.  It reminds me of an exam question from law school.  That being said, let's just stick to the horse.  If you know who the owner of the horse it, you can report him to the local law enforement for an abuse to animal charge.  Normally, if the horse has been abandoned for 3 years, consecutively, you could claim the horse as your property, if you didn't know who the owner actually was.  A horse is like a dog or other pet. If you choose to help a neighbor's dog with some food, you can ask the neighbor for money back, but your neighbor is not under a legal obligation to reimburse you.  Your best bet is to contact the horse's owner and discuss it with him.    Ask them to remove the horse or you will have it removed.  Or, say you can keep the horse there, but they need to pay you some $$ amount for your time and effort in keeping the animal healthy.  However, if the relative isn't paying on the land already,, I suspect the cousin isn't likely to send any money your way.  You can also have an attorney write a letter for you demanding action.  Sometime that will get thier attention.    If he/she does nothing, you can call animal control to have the horse removed from your property.  Unfortunately, the results for the horse are not usually very positive."

But if she does and you properly evict her, what is she going to sue over?"

1807965,"To be a bona fide tenant, you have to have been paying the full rent on time. If ""The landlord skipped town,"" to whom have you been paying rent? If you have not been paying rent, you are not a bona fide tenant.  Once the ownership of the rental property changes, you need to continue paying rent to the new owner. If you do not pay rent, you would be subject to being evicted from the rental.  While there are federal and state laws that restrict the new owner from evicting you after the purchase for up to 3 months if you are a month to month tenant, the laws require that you were and continue to be a bona fide tenant. If you have not been paying rent and do not continue to pay rent, I do not see how you can be a bona fide tenant.  If the rental property is within Seattle, the city's just cause ordinance may give you additional protection.  You should review the specific facts with your attorney to find out your legal options."
1798546,"If you wish to enter the rental property, you must give two days' written notice.  The notice must describe the date and time the entry will be conducted (a range is ok, but you must cover the entire period of the entry) and a phone number the tenants can call you at if they need to reschedule.  In general, giving more than the minimum notice is a good practice to keep the tenants happy.  You can refuse to rent to someone for any reason or no reason at all, provided you are not discriminating or retaliating for their exercise of their tenant rights.  If their current lease converts to month-to-month, and most do, you must give at least 20 days' advance notice before the end of a month that you are terminating the tenancy.  If the lease ends without such an option, no notice is required, but a courtesy notice is a good idea.  The tenant has an obligation to keep the premises clean during the tenancy and restore any damage before vacating.  Inspecting during the tenancy may give you an idea if you want to sign a new lease, but you will need to show the condition when they moved in if you wish to charge them for damages after they move out."
1787999,I disagree with all three answers. Although you may not  be able to resolve your problem administratively with CIS. But as one who have been here more than 10 years and have US relatives with no criminal records you are eligible for cancellation of removal and after grant you can obtain your residency in the US without leaving the country.

1792422,"First, you do not provide enough information to see if a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is beneficial for the corporation.  Does the business have assets that can be sold to pay debt?  Are the corporate assets pledged as security to a creditor.  These issues would need to be examined.  In that you have guaranteed the corporate debt, I would concentrate on your personal liability and how that liability effects you.  I would see a bankruptcy attorney to see if it might be wise for you to look into a personal bankruptcy regarding the guaranty debt.   If you start a business prior to filing a Bankruptcy Case, then that business will be a part of your Bankruptcy Estate and subject to a Chapter 7 Trustee seeing the new business as an asset that the Trustee could administer (unless you could find an exemption for that asset and if a Chapter 7 case is even a possibility).  I strongly suggest that you see an attorney who is experienced in Bankruptcy filings where significant business debt is an issue.  You raise many issues, but you do not give enough facts to determine any course of action.  Most Bankruptcy Attorneys will provide a free initial consultation to discuss options for you.  I would take advantage of that service.  This dialogue is for informational purposes only.  To give legal advise, many more facts need to be analyzed to determine your legal options.

1782379,"You definitely will need to consult a Family Law Attorney that handles appeals. I don't know what the issues are, but I gather it is too complicated to address here. I'm curious whether the second judge was in Family Law court or Probate court. If the second judge was in a probate proceeding, he may not have revisited any factual or legal questions from the divorce. Usually, the probate court would rely on the Family Court orders that are in place. My colleague answered correctly- I just wanted to add to a couple of your questions. First, any incompetence of the first attorney would not likely be imputed to the second attorney. If either attorney was incompetent, you may or may not have a claim against them. However, that is a different and specific area of practice. Also, prevailing in such claims can be quite challenging, and probably would not give you the relief you need. But talking to an attorney that handles malpractice would be necessary for you to evaluate your options there. Sending letters and documents to the second judge would not help. A judge cannot evaluate such things because they are considered informal ex parte (without the other party) communications. The judge would not even look at it.  You MAY be able to file a motion to reconsider; however, if the second ruling occurred in 2012 it may be a little late for that. Unfortunately, to answer all your questions, you may need to talk to a probate attorney, a malpractice attorney, and a family law attorney. The good news is that many attorneys offer free consultations, which may be all you need to answer some of your questions. An appellate Family Law attorney is likely to be your best bet."
1806043,"There is a process where the intestate heir can complete a form...swearing that they are the heir and that there are no other assets in the estate...and then get the title changed.

I would check with AAA, I have heard that they can assist you with the paperwork for a small fee."
1789978,"Oregon's expungement statute is long, complicated and always changing.  Currently, the crime of Assault 4 is eligible for expungement.  So the question becomes whether you are eligible for expungement.  If it has been less than 3 years since the date of your conviction, you are not eligible yet, and you will need to wait until at least three  years have passed.  If you are not yet in full compliance with your sentence - meaning having paid all fines, restitution, served all time, including probation time and any extra punishments for probation violations - you are not yet eligible, and will have to wait until you complete absolutely everything.  If you have another conviction on your record within the period of the day you file for expungement and 10 years prior to that day, you are not yet eligible.  In that case,  you will have to wait until 10 years have passed since the date of the earlier conviction.  This, by the way, is where I would think you might have the most trouble.  If you were convicted of the DUII as well, it would likely be around the same time, and you would have to wait out the 10-year period, not just the three-year period.  On the other hand, if you successfully completed diversion, no DUII conviction would be on your record to cause a problem.  Once you determine you are eligible, you have to file a ""Motion to Set Aside Conviction,"" pay the required fees ($240 filing fee / $80 to have your fingerprints taken); and possibly present a case to a judge.  Once you file, a hearing date will be set.  If the prosecution does not object, it's generally smooth sailing, but there is always a chance that the prosecutor will object, and argue against you.  Your victim will also have the right to make a statement.  The best thing you can do is make an appointment to consult with criminal defense attorney and go over your whole case.  Determine your eligiblility, and how much of a legal battle it will be.  If you are eligible, it is very worth your while to go for it!  Best of luck!"
1795448,"I'm confused.  Is the neighbor running a legitimate restaurant/bar and they're using their back yard without permit - or is it not even a restaurant/bar?  If they are NOT already a legitimate restaurant/bar, the police would most certainly shut them down for operating - and especially for serving/selling alcohol.  They received a ""cease and desist"" letter from whom?  Normally, the police and/or the Liquor Authority would not send a letter, they'd simply show up and shut them down.  Please elaborate.

1830315,You would file a Motion to Modify the prior order.  I don't see how that is in your best interests.  If you don't want the money--give it back to him each month.  That way if you break up it won't take you a lot of money or time to get the child support started again.
1801753,"Dear Lancaster Tenant:  I am an attorney licensed in New York State. I do not practice in Pennsylvania. The lease you claim you signed under duress may be your lifeline. Your landlord (co-worker, friend) cannot claim from you any rent greater than the rent you agreed as written in the lease,. So if there is a shortfall in income because your friend lost  a roommate, if the lease does not make you liable for the extra rent, your friend cannot legally claim you owe  money. That is how a lease provides protection against an arbitrary rent increase which your friend could impose if you did not have a written lease limiting the rent."
1830305,"You need to be served with a Summons and Complaint at least 21 days prior to the Court hearing here in the State of CO, if you were served in CO (which you were). If the debt was for less than $7,500 and it is a small claims case, the judge might very well believe that you have received sufficient notice. The 21 day requirement is for all County Court (over $7,500) and District Court (over $15,000) cases. Yours should be a County Court case and the 21 day notice applies. I would try to negotiate with the plaintiff who is suing you and also look into hiring an attorney. If you are able to make a lump sum payment or set up a payment plan, they will work with you. The threat of bankruptcy also causes a change in their mindset as well."
1797098,The defendant likely made a motion for summary judgment. Based on the facts you mentioned your lawyer did not have grounds to seek summary judgment.  These motions are typically made when discovery is completed.  I doubt delay had anything to do with it.  It doesn't sound like your lawyer did anything wrong.  You can change lawyers any time you want but I doubt that any other lawyer will take your case with a summary judgment motion pending.
1819003,"If you fire this employee now it is very likely that you will be hit with a wrongful termination/retaliation lawsuit that will be costly to defend.  You need to consult with an attorney who specializes in representing employers and they will be able to help you set up a plan to terminate this employee that will greatly minimize the risk of lawsuit to you.  These termination plans take a few months to complete - but after a few months, new policies (or enforcement of existing policy), internal investigation, and possibly a performance review, you will be ready to terminate this employee with the risk of a lawsuit that approaches zero.  The plan your attorney puts in place will document that you terminated the employee for performance and not as retaliation for a discrimination claim.  Again, if you fire the employee now it will most likely look like retaliation and you can likely expect a lawsuit soon to follow.  Hire an employer's attorney to guide you through this termination."

More importantly your violations are of alcohol use when you are being supervised for an alcohol offense.  The Judge will step up  treatment or requirements to prevent you from consuming. Get an attorney in the Travis County area. Do what you can to stop consuming alcohol.  Another DWI arrest will likely send you to prison.

1824118,"You should get an attorney to review it, but you're going to have to decide if you want to risk getting fired to have time to do so before you sign.  If you sign it first, have an attorney review it afterwards anyway.  Since the Reliable Fire Insurance decision from the IL Supreme Court, it's hard to say that any given contract is intrinsically enforceable, or unenforceable, but this one seems pretty aggressive, and prior case law indicates that a world-wide noncompete is unenforceable in itself.  Also there are now stricter requirements for consideration, a quid pro quo, for such a contract.  If you're an at will employee, you won't have much recourse if they do fire you for not signing, so think carefully about it.  If they're not paying you anything to sign, and you don't keep working there for a substantial period after signing, however, you'll have a decent argument that there was no consideration and it's not enforceable.  So if you're going to find another job and quit after signing, don't delay too long.  Talk to a lawyer first though.  Not having time to read the contract and consult a lawyer may in theory be a defense to enforcement, but don't count on it."

1794481,"These cases are really easy to beat if you get the right attorney.  In my experience there is never any proof of the debt and the courts are not at all sympathetic to the debt buyer.  You should also know that SSI/SSD is exempt and cannot be garnished under the law in most cases.  Cars do not have that exemption and can be levied.  That is why you should fight the lawsuit, unless it is for a very small amount of money that would not justify the legal fees.    If the case is for a very small sum, like, for example $500 to $1000, it may not pay to hire a lawyer.  Most attorneys will charge $500 to $1500 for court appearances in DJ Court.  In that case, just tell the court you are going to defend. There is a good chance the plaintiff will not even appear.  If you do appear, you will be called to the stand-you don't want that. That is why it is good to have a lawyer go for you. However, if you cannot afford a lawyer and the suit is for a small amount of money, just take the chance they won't show and do not go yourself.  If there is a judgment and you then want to challenge it, you have 30 days to appeal to the Common Pleas Court.  You can then get a lawyer if you wish, or, better yet, you may be able to just settle the claim for less than you would pay the lawyer.  If the claim is more than $1000-$1500, you should serious start to inquire about legal fees and try to beat the claim."

The Judge will most likely take you into custody and set a probation violation hearing two to four weeks later. On that date the DA and your defense attorney will negotiate a disposition for you. There may be a probation report generated with a recommendation. If you are on felony probation you could receive anything from 180 straight time or State Prison, depending on your record. The sooner you take care of it the better. If you wait until the cops pick you up on a warrant that will make things worse for you. If you are on misdemeanor probation and you turn yourself in to do straight time the most you will get is 365 days at half time.

In police cases such as disorderly conduct, the accused must appear in person...no exceptions.""  I can see why you think a non-lawyer can assist someone in traffic court. The language certainly makes it look as if this is the case. Based on the second passage I found, it seems that a non-lawyer may assist the defendant in some cases, but not in others. Neither passage makes it completely clear in which types of cases a non-lawyer may participate, however. I did not look further to see if I could find additional information.  The default in legal proceedings is that only a lawyer can represent another person. But there are exceptions from time to time. Therefore the answer to your question is that more research is required.  If I were you,  I would call the traffic court and ask for clarification as to whether a non-lawyer may assist someone in the specific kind of traffic court case you are looking into. That will quickly resolve your issue.  Best of luck."

But if he signed a note and then didn't pay you you would have a pretty easy case selling strictly on the note anyways. Like the previous response mentions collection will be the difficult part. The only advantage of suing for fraud in addition to suing on the note itself is that it judgment based on fraud cannot be discharged in bankruptcy while the regular unsecured note could be discharged in bankruptcy.

1806388,"This depends on the local rules of court applicable to your case. Each jurisdiction has their local rules available on their county website. That being said, you typically do not need to, but the question is also making sure that your particular judge does not let you know that you should have on the day of trial, leaving you out of luck. Because Contempt hearings are quasi-criminal they can be broken up into as many as three hearings: the arraignment phase, the pre-trial phase, and the trial itself. At the time of the arraignment, the pleadings are considered to make sure they set forth a cause of action and the defending party advises the court as to their plea, i.e., guilty or not guilty. If the Court sets the case for pre-trial, in my experience judge's tend to look favorably at exhibit lists (and oftentimes the exhibits themselves) and witness lists being provided. The reason for this is tied to the quasi-criminal nature of a contempt (which I referenced, above). In a criminal hearing, the District Attorney is required to voluntarily provide the Defendant with a copy of their discovery. Likewise, at least in theory, that should happen in family law contempt hearings as well. I also find it handy to bring a number of copies of the exhibits to court for use at trial. The rule of thumb is bring 4 copies - one for the Court, one for the opposing counsel/party, one for yourself, and for the witness. You can also pre-mark them if you'd like. Regardless, you can always use an ""undisclosed"" exhibit for the purposes of impeachment. Technically, impeachment exhibits do not come in as substantive evidence for the truth of the matter asserted (although you can't un-ring the bell!), and are geared toward undermining the credibility of the witness and, as an offshoot of this, the weight of their testimony. Good luck with your case! Armed with this information, I'm sure you will do great!"

1933572,"n determining whether an award of alimony is appropriate and, if so, what type, duration and amount, family court judges are guided by the following statutory factors: (1) The actual need and ability of the parties to pay;  (2) The duration of the marriage or civil union;  (3) The age, physical and emotional health of the parties;  (4) The standard of living established in the marriage or civil union and the likelihood that each party can maintain a reasonably comparable standard of living, with neither party having a greater entitlement to that standard of living than the other;  (5) The earning capacities, educational levels, vocational skills, and employability of the parties;  (6) The length of absence from the job market of the party seeking maintenance;  (7) The parental responsibilities for the children;  (8) The time and expense necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment, the availability of the training and employment, and the opportunity for future acquisitions of capital assets and income;  (9) The history of the financial or non-financial contributions to the marriage or civil union by each party including contributions to the care and education of the children and interruption of personal careers or educational opportunities;  (10) The equitable distribution of property ordered and any payouts on equitable distribution, directly or indirectly, out of current income, to the extent this consideration is reasonable, just and fair;  (11) The income available to either party through investment of any assets held by that party;  (12) The tax treatment and consequences to both parties of any alimony award, including the designation of all or a portion of the payment as a non-taxable payment;  (13) The nature, amount, and length of pendente lite support paid, if any; and   (14) Any other factors which the court may deem relevant.    Governor Christie recently signed alimony reform legislation. One of the big changes was placing limitations on the duration of alimony in marriages that are less than 20 years. Since your first marriage is less than 20 years, the new law does not permit the length of your alimony to exceed the length of your marriage. However, it important to note that judges still have discretion to deviate from this rule in the case of exceptional circumstances. It is important that you discuss the specifics of your situation with an experienced matrimonial attorney to learn what your rights are, how to protect them and how the changes to the alimony laws can affect your case. Additionally, below are links to articles and information that may assist you with your case."

1825607,"Yes, in Florida, when the court notices a case for a hearing on dismissal based on Lack of Prosecution (""LOP""), the plaintiff has a period within which to file papers constituting record activity in order to avoid the dismissal. If plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment prior to the deadline, that would surely constitute sufficient activity. If plaintiff missed the deadline the court might conduct the hearing as scheduled anyway, and plaintiff would have to show good cause for neglecting the case for so long. If you are unsure, consult a lawyer and check with the judge's office to see if the hearing is still set for this case: usually, LOP dockets are set with multiple cases all at once; some will be removed when record activity appears in advance.

The consumer is well advised to hire an attorney experienced in defending such cases in the particular court.  An attorney familiar with the rules of evidence and local procedure can often exclude enough of the debt buyer's ""evidence"" to win the case or force a dismissal.

As an at will employee, you can be fired by the employer at any time for any reason with or without notice as long as the employer is not breaking some other law in firing you. You have the same right to quit at any time.  The employer would be breaking the law if the employer fired you because of your protected characteristic (such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.) or protected activity (such as union organizing, filing a worker's comp claim, serving on a jury, etc.). More information about unlawful discrimination is at www.hum.wa.gov .  Looking for an employer closer to home is not a protected characteristic or activity.  Firing you due to a mistaken belief that you were moving on is also not unlawful. The law does not require the employer to be correct in its assumptions. Firing an employee who may or may be looking for other employment is not unlawful in itself.  The employer cannot keep your personal belongings. You can contact someone at the employer to arrange for the return of your personal belongings.  If you qualify for unemployment benefits, you can apply at www.esd.wa.gov . Unless the employer can prove that you were fired for misconduct, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits.

1668704,"You will need to retain a lawyer to review your case and determine if its worth pursuing. Its impossible to predict or evaluate your claim in a public forum like this. There are too many fact-dependent issues to address. But generally here are my thoughts.  This is a very tough question to answer because it involves the intersection of (1) contract law (2) intellectual property law and (3) potential tort law in two areas (i) invasion of privacy and (ii) possible defamation (a straight tort) and false light (another invasion of privacy tort).  1. Contract law: When you volunteer to perform a duty without consideration, you are considered exactly that, a volunteer. There is no consideration supporting your performance other than your altruistic intentions of helping someone or the mission of the organization out.  Concomitant with your waiver of consideration in performing gratuitous services, the organization that you did the work for at no charge, owes an obligation to hold you out in the light most favorable to the general public in a truthful manner. In other words if you support saving trees, then the organization can hold you out as a ""tree hugger"". That's fine. That is the intent and purpose of your gratuitous association with the organization.    What happens is sometimes that contract is breached when, after you have performed gratuitously, the organization trash-talks you, which is contrary to the consideration of your performance. That is, they are no longer saying you're a ""tree hugger"" but instead calling you a tree molester.   At that point they are using your name and likeness for a purpose that it was not intended to be used for. At that point they have exceeded their license to use your name and likeness.  (A.) The production company may have a release from you, but if you were not provided a copy or signed it without having the opportunity to read it, or take it to a lawyer, it may not be worth anything. In California releases are scrutinized very carefully by the courts.   For instance in an actor/talent release form, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, if after signing the agreement, the performance you render is used in a manner that you no longer approve of. Since the consideration for the release is gratuitous, its very hard for the party using the performance to continue its use without your permission.  If you disassociate yourself with this non-profit, you do have a right to withdraw your consent.  Whether this right is enforceable depends on what you signed. I suggest you contact the company that handed you the paper to sign and get a copy of it.  2. Intellectual Property Law:  California has a good statute protecting you from unauthorized uses of your image and performances.  Cal. Civil Code 3344-3346 protects the unauthorized use of your image and performance. What consists of ""unauthorized"" is dependent on how your contract with the production company is interpreted by the courts.  However, as I said, when rendering gratuitous performances, there is no consideration involved other than altruistic motives, you can withdraw your consent.  In a gratuitous performance you are licensing your rights out to someone. But since there is no consideration, the license MAY be revocable. So if you revoke your consent, they may not be able to continue to associate you with the non-profit.  3. Tort Law:  (a). Invasion of Privacy. If the non-profit ""blacklisted"" you, that may be cause for a suit against them for defaming you and invading your privacy.  1.  Slanders or libels occurs if someone knowingly makes a false statement that is of and concerning you which is false or is known to be false at the time the statement is made, which a third person heard or read, and reasonably believed it, which ultimately causes damage to your reputation. There are legal and technical defenses to defamation.   2. False light is similar to defamation only its a true statement but spins it in a false light."

You would likely recover the amount of damages their actions had on you--which would be far less than an attorney would cost and far less than your own time is worth.    You might consider contacting WalMart Corporate Headquarters and reporting the incident.  Perhaps they will make some amends."

1822644,"The property must be habitable and must have, among other things, working plumbing and a supply of hot and cold water.  RCW 59.18.060(8), (11).  In a recent development in Washington, a court ruled that if a residence is so obviously defective that it is uninhabitable at the commencement of the tenancy, the tenant can refuse to take occupancy and be released from the lease.  From your description, this property meets that standard.  You should document the condition when you attempted to take possession in case you need to prove it in court if the landlord sues for non-payment or other damages.  Take as many photos as possible and keep contact information for any witnesses you may have.  Make sure you clearly notify the landlord, in writing, that you will not be moving in because of the defects."
1815609,"While it is understandable that the modification of child support has triggered your renewed interest in seeing your daughter the fact that you went for two years without making an effort to fix this won't be perceived very well by the court.  The courts see child support as getting money to support the child and visitation or parenting time as putting time into raising the child and the courts don't like to see the payment of support cross referenced with parenting time.  These are two different functions in the court's mind.    You need to be very careful not to let the court perceive that the increase in support is your motivation to demand time with your daughter.  That said you are not the first parent to be driven away but a former partner and miss time with their child and you are entitled to the court's sympathies.  Just keep the child support matter as a something separate when it comes up in conversation.  If you already have a parenting plan that is not being followed, go to the court house and fill out and file the form requesting enforcement.  If a detailed parenting plan was never set up, fill out the form to request a modification of the custody/parenting plan situation so that you will have a detailed plan as to when you have time with your daughter and once it is spelled out on paper you will have more enforcement rights.  Your daughter needs you and surely misses you - so put a rush on this.  (My experience is that the more that one parent bad mouths the other parent, the more the child wants to spend time with the other parent and resents the negative comments.)"

1829288,"More information would be useful - are you on a term lease or a month-to-month?  Is there any sort of rent control that governs your area or rental?  Undoubtedly a New York licensed landlord-tenant attorney will respond and can tell you definitively but if you have not gotten at least 30 days advanced written notice terminating your lease (maybe more since you have been there over a year - here in Oregon it would need to be 60 days notice), you cannot be forced out.  However, if or when you do get proper notice, lawfully served, your time will start running and you will have to be out within the time frame or face a potential eviction on your record and if you think it is hard to find another rental now, it will be considerably harder if you have been evicted by your last landlord.  Otherwise, no, a landlord is not obligated to pay your moving expenses or rent money.  On the other hand, if they really want you out soon, they may well contribute towards your expenses in order to get what they want.  You can't force it but they can voluntarily cut such a deal with you - it happens quite frequently actually and assuming things are not terrible between you and your mom, she might particularly be willing to help out in this situation.  Good luck."
1819911,"I agree with the other answers. If it was done pursuant to a divorce, your recourse is in supreme court. Depending on how long has elapsed, you may consider moving for a modification based upon change of circumstances. If it is a hardship, then a court may hang its hat on that issue to assist you. But you need to confer with an attorney."

1818168,"I shall accept that by $50k/$100k/$50k, you mean that the at-fault driver carried personal injury coverage of $50K per person with a total of $100K per accident and $50,000 in property damage.  1.) NOT your settlement, but the monies available for your medical care.  If the at-fault driver and passenger use up $40,000, there's only $5,000 of the med pay left for you.  2.) If your injuries merit payment of $50,000 and the remaining unused med pay, your injuries may well justify additional payment under your Underinsurance coverage.  3.) You MUST hire an attorney TODAY or risk zero recovery by blowing the statute.  It is NOT as simple as walking into the clerk's office and paying the filing fee.  You MUST draft a Complaint so you have something to file.  And a Summons for the Sheriff to serve, etc."

1825458,"My clients have been told at least a 9 month wait time. The filing fee waiver will have no effect. there is no priority in the land of due process and equal opportunity to join the back of the queue.  Remember the card is just proof of status. But think about whether you want to stay on a card - and risk pitfalls that many good people fall into, that can lead them into removal proceedings - when in 90 days you could be taking the oath ceremony and joining another queue - for jury service and voting. Do go see a professional first, if you choose to make yourself safe."
1822023,"Sure, it is possible that you will be served with a lot of motions in limine. That is the right of the other party.  Courts will generally entertain motions in limine even if they were filed late, or there was no meet and confer between the parties.  If you get some, just make sure you respond appropriately."
1799596,"Assuming both notices are otherwise legal and legally served to the opposing party, then both notices are presumably legally enforceable.  If the tenant gave notice first, and is not out by that date, then it can be enforced by the landlord.  If something prevents enforcement of the tenant's notice, then the landlord can fall back on enforcing their own notice once its time has come without the tenant vacating."
1789637,"Employers have no duty whatsoever to determine if you have vacation plans.  When you go to work for an employer, you serve at their pleasure, and previously made vacation plans get no legal consideration.  If your employer made knowingly false statements to you about being able to take the vacation you might have a legal claim for some kind of misrepresentation or estoppel, but then you are at odds with your employer - something that you likely do not want to do.  It is unfortunate that your employer is not able to accommodate your vacation needs.  However, it is not advisable to sue your employer over a lost vacation.  That is up to you.  Good luck."

1830384,I'm not sure I understand your question.  Many small firms refer out larger cases to larger law firms.  The issue of the expert is puzzling.  You can get any expert to review medical records if you pay them.  I think what this attorney is actually saying is that he isn't comfortably spending the kind of money he needs to on an expert until he gets someone elses opinion about the viability of your case. Your attorney needs to get your consent to partner with another law firm (unless the fee agreement specifies that they may do so).  If your attorney does work with another firm it should not cost you any additional money since the fees to be split by the attorneys should be based on the percetange specified in your fee agreement.  In other words if your fee agreement says the attorney is to get 1/3 of the amount recovered then the two attorneys have to divide up the 1/3 and you would still be entitled to the 2/3.  Medical malpractice and wrongful death claims are difficult and expensive and take years to get done.  Don't let the initial evaluation stage drag on too long.  You should have some answers about the viability of your case after a year.
1822875,"I agree with Mr. Hines.  Hidden fees, if they are not in the contract, are usually illegal. Texas I am sure follows the same basic framework that other states follow, in that there is a standard landlord/tenant act.  There is also a consumer protection/unfair and deceptive trade practice act on the books which may apply since a lease if this is residential, is a consumer transaction. Hidden fees are usually fraudulent or illegal and so the landlord is simply intimidating to keep the deposit and dissuade the tenant from suing, just as you pointed out.  Click on ""Find a Lawyer"" above and try and find a landlord/tenant attorney to set up a consult with. Most states that have a landlord/tenant act also have attorney fees provisions, as likely the written lease does too. If the landlord is clearly in the wrong, its possible the landlord will have to pay the deposit back and get socked with damages and attorney fees."
1820438,"Why did the Judge set a value in the opinion if you lost? Are you sure the Judge didn't just say the amount you were seeking? You can sue the Board of Managers of the Condo. However, the Judge's decision will not get collateral estoppel effect because the Condo was not part of the case. That is why you should have sued everyone in one case."
1802939,"First of all, I'm sorry to hear that your friend was hurt and hope that she makes a full recovery.  Where a person like your friend is harmed as the result of the negligent conduct of another person, the injured person can make file a lawsuit seeking compensation for personal injuries and damages, including medical bills.  Probably the most important part of your friend's case is going to be proving that the driver did something wrong, or was somehow negligent.  You haven't alleged that the driver was cited for speeding, or was texting, drunk, failed to stop at a stop sign, went through a red light, or violated some other rule of the road.  You should not expect that a driver who is traveling the legal speed limit will be able to stop safely when a pedestrian is in the middle of a road at night.  Based on the reaction you are getting from lawyers, my guess is that your friend crossed in the middle of the road at night, without the benefit of a crosswalk or walk signal, which may make her responsible for her own injuries.  In other words, your friend had no right to be in the middle of the road at the time she was struck, and that may prevent or severely lessen any compensation for her injuries.  As her friend, you want to see her receive as much help as possible, but the law will generally not make another person pay your friend's injuries unless they are found to have done something wrong.  I wouldn't give up entirely, and I would probably pursue a claim with the hope of receiving some compensation, but I think, depending on the facts, you may need to dramatically lower your expectations."
1821817,"It is within the school's discretion to have a policy mandating purchase of its policy for student health insurance. There are a number of factors that go into that decision making process and I would expect the number of schools doing this will decline, but there is nothing unconstitutional about it on its face. If your school is a public school, the policy must meet muster in terms of implementation, but if it is a private school, I cannot imagine any constitutional prohibition. Look at the student handbook to determine if there are any avenues for waiving the requirement. That is the only possible solution that I can see."
1804431,"If paternity has not been established, the police may have more authority if you claim the child was kidnapped.  Now if you voluntarily gave him the child, I don't know what they would do.  However, once you do have a parenting plan in place that acknowledges that he is the father and sets a time sharing schedule, the police will tell you there is nothing they can do and you'll have to file motions with the court to secure the return of the child and to take steps to ensure this does not happen again, such as with supervised contact."
1830461,"With the information you have provided, it sounds like your company retaliated against you for going on light duty and they discriminated against you due to your physical limitations."
1791980,"There are a lot of factors that determine whether you will receive alimony or not in your divorce:   - each spouse‰Ûªs earning capacity, separate estate, financial resources, and debts - each spouse‰Ûªs contributions to the marriage, including homemaking, child care, education, and career building for the other spouse - the marital standard of living - each spouse‰Ûªs age, and physical and emotional condition - any time necessary for either spouse to obtain education and training for appropriate employment, and - the length of the marriage.  Your answer talks about a few of these (length of marriage and current educational needs), but the other factors should be discussed confidentially with an experienced attorney to see what the likely outcomes will be.    Whether you file first or your spouse files first is not one of the factors in determining alimony.    Obtaining an alimony award with a short marriage is not as easy as with a long marriage.  So, you will need a lawyer experienced at helping people like you get the results that they need."
1943138,"Just because you have 40k in debt does not mean you need to pay all of it back. That depends on liquidation analysis.

1961646,Your best bet is to write a letter to the Judge which sets out your concerns. Do not raise legal arguments or attempt to paint your ex in a bad light. It appears she is doing that on her own. Keep it to a page or less. I would suggest tracking down the clerk in the courtroom in between cases and asking for a minute of his/her time. Give the letter to the clerk to give to the judge. Mailing the letter may also work depending on time.
1805923,You need to file a Petition for Probate to be Administrator.  It would be a competing petition to your brother's.  Your attorney should be able to help you with this.

Good luck."
1813746,"The simple answer is that he must file in a state where his child has lived legally for six months. So, moving to another state with the child will delay the time when he can file.  If he is in the military now he should consult a lawyer familiar with military law and how it can effect the residency of the child.  Military people generally keep their original state of residency when they are in the service if that is the state to which they intend to return, the state where they vote, pay taxes etc.  Again... consult an attorney about jurisdiction."

1869698,"You are very smart to start asking questions now.  I recommend that you not take any more money out of your retirement account until you talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney.    Please understand that bankruptcy is a very complicated process.  I am attaching a link to some free videos that explain how bankruptcy works.  Most Arizona consumer bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation about the basics of bankruptcy.  Please take time to educate yourself about bankruptcy and to determine which attorney is the best to assist you in the process.  Don‰Ûªt assume the attorney is being completely honest about their experience and capabilities.  Check them out.  Beware of firms we call ""mills"".  Make sure to talk to the attorney you will be working with, not a staff person.  When interviewing the attorney ask them how long they have practiced bankruptcy law.  Ask what percentage of their practice is focused on consumer work.  Ask whether they are experienced in both chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases.  Ask the attorney for references.  Ask about their policy of returning phone calls.  They should be committed to answering specific questions about your situation and help you understand your options.  If, after talking with them you are still confused about the issues you raised, find another attorney.  Check them out with the various ranking sources: such as www.AVVO.com, and the State Bar.  An attorney is should be your guide through this process.  They should educate you, be there to assist you in how to avoid pitfalls and help you plan for your future after bankruptcy.  There are hundreds of ""bankruptcy"" attorneys in Arizona.  Of those just a few will fit the criteria set forth above.  Again, bankruptcy is a very complicated process and you want to use an attorney who will be there when you need them.

1807596,"What is normal varies from case to case.  There are only a few things an attorney can do preindictment. He can file a motion to reduce bond. He can request an examining trial, which is largely a formality but can serve some strategic purposes. He can also file a grand jury packet to try to prevent an indictment if the facts warrant it. How each case is handled depends on the specifics of each case. You need to have a sit down with the attorney you hired to get a better understanding of what's going on before you decide to hire a new lawyer."
1815700,"It sounds as if you are seeking to sue a former attorney for an adverse result you got in a prior legal proceeding.  Such cases are handled by attorneys practicing Tort law (ie-personal injury) but you should look for one who has experience handling legal malpractice cases, who will work on a contingency fee basis - meaning you do not pay a fee unless you are successful.  Be aware that legal malpractice cases generally require you to prove two critical things:  First, you must prove that the attorney failed to properly represent you in the former case, by not meeting the standards of legal representation that was necessary or required under the facts or circumstances of that prior legal matter.   The fact that you lost or got an adverse result does not, by itself, prove that the attorney did not properly represent you.  Also, an act of an attorney based on a tactical decision or judgment does not automatically prove malpractice just because that decision did not produce a successful result.  Secondly, you would have to prove that you would have won your prior legal matter (gotten a favorable result) had the attorney acted properly in representing you.   In other words, if the attorney committed malpractice but it can't be shown that you would have likely prevailed in the former matter regardless of that malpractice, then your legal malpractice claim will be dismissed."

1793526,"You reference a no contact clause. Was it written to apply to both parties equally? if so, she would be appear to be eligible for bringing her back to court for being in contempt of the order.    Is it worth the expense is a fair question.  If there are no issues involved other than the contact itself, why even open the letters.  Dropping the unwanted letters in the outside dead paper receptacle or returning the letters, unopened and without any other communication added, may be adequate and accomplished at minimal to no expense."
1800134,"What you really need to do is find an experienced bankruptcy attorney other than the one who filed the ch 7. Look on AVVO. Then I am not saying you should file unless you cannot afford all your debts. But you want to defend yourself in that adversary lawsuit or in the civil lawsuit. If liable, then there are other issues as follows below   You may  need, depending on outcome of that lawsuit or likelihood of winning to file a bankruptcy  and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!  That civil lawsuit on fraud they will discuss with you. THE GOOD NEWS: FRAUD IN BANKRUPTCY COURT IS NOT THE SAME..MAKE SURE THE ATTORNEY CAREFULLY EXPLAINS EACH OF THE ELEMENTS !   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

1791588,"Your CC&Rs appear to be in compliance with the law. [See Civil Code å¤5655(a)].   The law is unclear, however, with respect to issues of chronic delinquency.   The practice you mention would cause a late fee to be charged every time a payment is made unless it also pays the delinquency in full. The practice is not forbidden by Davis-Sterling but it is not equitable.   IMO, an owner can prevent this practice by simply noting on each check the month and year for which the payment is being made and noting the most recent month and year so that payment for that month is timely."
1816944,"There are missing pieces on your explanation. In particular, what is your current status? Also, has your employer mentioned anything about your expiring EAD to you?

Hopefully nothing is happening and you will get your new EAD before September 1, but it's impossible to tell without a closer look. Considering the stakes, it would be a good idea for you to do a consultation with an immigration attorney. It may also help you feel better."
1821095,"Changing the temporary order requires going back to court and proving a substantial change has occurred in the family situation since the temporary order was signed. If the temporary order was recent, that will be a high burden to overcome. If you find the temporary order inconvenient or undesirable then you probably won't have a good chance of changing the order on that basis. You may have better luck, depending on the judge, if both parents agree to a change in the order on the basis that both parents find the temporary order unworkable.   If the kid is manipulating the situation then the best remedy is likely parenting the child rather than expecting the court to figure out how to make the situation workable."
1817291,"Any time an attorney-in-fact uses a POA to do anything that provides a benefit to the attorney-in-fact, it's subject possible scrutiny.  That doesn't necessarily mean it's void, but, as I'm sure you can understand, on its face it presents the possibility that the attorney-in-fact took advantage of the principal.  From what I can tell, the threshold question will be whether the deed was prepared before or after your mother's death.  If after, the deed is no good because a power of attorney does not survive the death of the principal.  Assuming the deed was prepared before her death, the language of the POA itself, read in tandem with the POA statute, may have a lot to do with the results.  For example, a POA will sometimes expressly authorize the attorney-in-fact to make a gift to himself, but sometimes within limitations. On the other hand, they sometimes expressly prohibit self-dealing or making gifts to the AIF.    If the language of the POA itself doesn't shed enough light on the question, there 's always the duty of the AIF to act in the best interest of the principal, and that does not always mean following the instructions of the principal (such as instructions to prepare a deed in favor of the attorney-in-fact), because sometimes the principal is not capable of deciding what is in his or her best interest.  However, you stated your mother did not have dementia, so her instructions may well carry a lot of weight, but once you're down to determining whether the AIF acted in the best interest of the principal, it's difficult to predict where a court will come out on the question."

See Cal. Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 724.010 to 724.100. In particular, CCP section 724.050 states that you should serve personally or by mail a written demand to the attorney of record with the warning that they must file the acknowledgment within 15 days of receipt or the judgment debtor may institute court proceedings, which can include recovery of the debtor's attorney's fees plus damages, if the failure is without just cause.  Moreover, collecting more than is permitted by law may be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), if this was a mostly consumer debt (not mostly business purposes), for which you and your consumer attorney can file suit within a year and seek and award for damages and attorney's fees.

Objections to halt production are generally made by the third party who was served with the subpoena.

1800068,"The creditor probably hasn't sent a garnishment summons directed to any particular account. Rather they have sent a Summons to a bank for all property belonging to the judgment debtor whose social security number is xxx xx xxxx.  The bank dutifully freezes all accounts with that name and/or SSN attached to them.  Then the account holder, if it is not that individual has 14 days to contact the judgment creditor's attorney and complaint get it's bank account unfrozen.  If the business is incorporated, or is an LLC, the business' lawyer should write to the creditor's lawyer, provide  a copy of an account statement showing it is the company account, not the individual's account, and demand that they release the money.  If the business is not an LLC or a corporation, then it is not a legal entity capable of having a bank account, and the money belongs to the individual who opened the account, or if it is a joint account, to the person who deposited the money."
1579534,"There is a federal statute that MAY apply in your case.  The statue prohibits the possession of a firearm by those convicted of crimes ofa misdemeanor crime of  domestic violence.  Here is the relevant language. A ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" means an offense that: is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law; has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon; and was committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim. However, a person is not considered to have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence unless: the person was represented by counsel in the case, or knowingly and intelligently waived the right of counsel in the case; and in the case of a prosecution for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, either ‰ÛÓ the case was tried by a jury, or the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise. In addition, a conviction would not be disabling if it has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored (if the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held provides for the loss of civil rights upon conviction for such an offense) unless the pardon, expunction, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms, and the person is not otherwise prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held from receiving or possessing firearms.

1823783,"The rule is listed in the Municipal Code of Chicago at 4-4-152. It disallows a license to anyone owning 25% or more in the applicant who is ""delinquent on any court-ordered child support arrearage[ment] or has failed to comply with a child support withholding notice.""  Because you are delinquent, you are probably going to have problems. The ordinance does not allow for leeway.   If you are not honest about the delinquent support on the application, it could be even worse for you. If the Department of Business Affairs finds the lie, they will then have an additional reason to deny the license. That would also be a reason to deny you any license in the future. If the Department issues the license and later finds out that you lied, they will revoke the license.  How soon will you be current in your payments? Can it wait until you are current?"

1789793,"You have asked two different questions, the first regarding service.  Simply put, you must try to obtain your ex's new address.  You must keep track of each method used and if still unsuccessful, you must then file a motion for alternative service with the court to show all of the steps taken and why an alternative to normal service should be acceptable to the court.  You may wish to contact a process server and / or an attorney in SC to see if they can track him down. As to your second question, the one year requirement for an absolute divorce is still a requirement.  Having a husband leave the state does not give you new grounds for an absolute divorce.  Good luck."

1802532,"There are a number of factors that could affect sentencing in this situation. Since your husband has a prior charge, he clearly won't be eligible for a diversion program. The real question is whether the State will seek jail time or probation (or some combination thereof). If the theft is charged as a second degree misdemeanor, then the maximum sentence could be up to sixty days in jail or six months on probation. On the other hand, if it's charged as a first degree misdemeanor, the maximum is up to a year in jail or up to a year on probation. You should definitely seek counsel for him for this case. An experienced defense attorney can advise you on how to proceed."
1788659,"This is a fact dependent question:  Your husband is only an accomplice if he knew your son had the card and ""knew or should have known"" your son did not have permission to have it AND intended to use it. As pointed out above, to try and prosecute your husband, you would need to prosecute your son. This seems like, in most cases, a very bad idea. Even then, proving your husband's guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" would be difficult unless he made an admission  or witnessed all of the elements above."

651371,"You need have a consult with a tax attorney. What you posted is ill-advised because you are mixing concepts of profit and non-profit entities.   A profit making entity (smaill business) is for your beneifit. A non-profit entity is for either the benefit of the public or its membership, but you cannot have as its ""non-profit"" purpose you sole benefit.   Soliciting ""donations"" for your personal benifit is not only a profit making venture, it could also be deemed criminal. Statements like""I am thinking of starting it with a nonprofit license so that I pay a lower tax and collect more of what comes in so that I can actually make some money."" and ""I am also thinking of starting it as a nonprofit to qualify for a grants and for added credibility that could make my website more likely to turn an actual profit."" are dangerous statements to be publishing on a website.

1818944,"Your husband's name does not have to be on the deed.  Due to our homestead laws in FL, your husband has to join in on the mortgage, but he does not have to sign the promissory note (or the deed).  Assuming there is no sort of transferred liability or other similar theories that the IRS can argue, a house purchased in your individual name should not be at risk of your husband's IRS debt.  Do not put him on the deed or his tax lien will attach to the property.   Innocent spouse is not applicable in this case (that is where both spouses are liable on a tax debt and one spouse wants to be relieved ob the tax obligation)."
1801832,That isn't the sort of question an attorney can answer without a lot more information.  Generally:  If the children have been here for less than 6 months Texas can make emergency orders about the children but then you will still have to litigate about their custody in Kentucky.

1828661,"The issue of a small estate is probably independent of the trust.  If there are assets in the trust (which it actually appears from your description there are not), they pass via the trust.  If there are non-probate assets (the joint accounts and beneficiary designated IRA) they have nothing to do with the trust or will.  If the will pours assets over into the trust, you have to decide if it is worth it to deal with those funds.  The one issue I would want to know about is how will this HELOC be treated - if it is due from the probate estate AND/OR the living trust you'll have to deal with it at some point so whether its through the estate or trust it might not matter - a living trust is not a debt-avoidance tool so ""estate statutory"" debts can still be due even though you say there are only $600 in the estate.  My advice is to see a lawyer so you know how to handle this properly."
1814278,"Each of you needs to compromise here to find a way to communicate that satisfies you both. Perhaps talk on the phone but only about certain topics.  Email but only one issue per mail.  Soliit the help of a parenting coordinator.   That said, it sounds like you don't have a parenting plan in place.  You should.  Frankly, that eliminates the need to communicate as often as you are now, gives the kids a solid expectation for visitation and it takes away the control that your ex has over your time with the kids.    Speak to an attorney about your case and get yourself a parenting plan.    Good Luck!"
1795109,I do not believe that this will affect your ability to get a license as long as you were not cited. One thing you have to be careful about is a little known requirement that you notify the DMV of all accidents that involve more than $500 in damage.   As far as the effect on your friend's insurance rates. I have heard different things but I am confident in saying that it will probably increase the rates for the next three years and it will be on their Choice Point record for ten years. Choice Point is a company that maintains records of claims and then sells that information to insurance companies. There are ways to dispute that information and you may want to help your friend ensure that the information is accurate. (That they were not driving and it should not count against them.)
1814496,"The answer depends on what it says in your divorce decree.  Usually the court will retain jurisdiction to enter a post-secondary educational support order when the kids get closer to college age.  If the decree does not state the percentage allocated to each parent then you can go to court to have the court issue a more precise order.  Unless the decree states otherwise, the amount both parents are obligated to contribute is limited to the amount that it costs for an in-state student to attend University of Connecticut.  If the college expense language is in the decree, then it will be a court order, and the parents will be required to pay.  It is not optional."
1827372,I would start with the Hall of records in LA. If they don't have the information you can try using an internet search company or you can hire a P.I. to investigate. But it should be in the hallecords.

If they still don't serve verified responses, you can move for sanctions, including dismissal.  I do think, however, that you should probably have legal counsel handling this case for you.  If you are not well versed in civil procedure, you may well lose on a technicality.   Good luck!"
1830083,"It can be either a 4th degree crime or a DP offense, depending on the specific nature of the location you are accused of trespassing onto. Given your facts, it appears that it is graded as a DP offense, still within the criminal code, but not a crime. In addition, if it is being handled in the Municipal Court it is a DP, as the Municipal Courts cannot handle charges graded as crimes. The problem will be whether the prosecutor and the Judge will both agree to a criminal offense being downgraded to a charge under the municipal code. Some courts are being very restrictive about this type of downgrade, while others seem to be more willing to consider it if the facts support the downgrade. I agree with my colleagues that this is something you should discuss with an experienced NJ criminal defense lawyer before you go to Court, and you may want to consider retaining the lawyer, as the atty will be in a better position to negotiate this with the prosecutor and if needed, to try to convince the Judge to accept as a disposition."
1797095,"CCP 437c (g) requires the court, upon granting a MSJ, to set forth the reasons for its determination, and to make specific references to the evidence supporting and opposing the motion to show that no triable issue of fact exists.  The court is permitted to do this by making an oral record by court reporter, or by a written ruling.    If the court made his statement of decision in open court, with a court reporter present, then that's probably your ""statement of decision"".  If no oral ruling setting forth the court's reasoning and evidence was made, and the court requested parties to submit proposed rulings, and that has not been done, then you can probably file a subsequent motion requesting a ""statement of decision"" asking the court to set forth its reasons and evidence relied on in a written order.    Bear in mind, the court is not going to be pleased with your request because it will make him do more work.  He (or she) will probably adopt whatever the other side proposes.    Then, you take that up to the Court of Appeals.  If the court does nothing in response to your request for a statement of decision, then that will be another ground for your appeal.  Having said all of that, I would also join in the suggestions that you hire an attorney immediately to evaluate your problem."

1798823,"At most hearings, oral arguments are heard. It is also possible that testimony will be received by the court at such a hearing. Oral arguments at hearings are most often concerning a particular matter in a case rather than the entire merits of the case, the latter of which occurs mostly at trial. A summary judgment hearing is a little different than other hearings because an entire case may be disposed of. A summary judgment hearing decides whether the undisputed facts can serve as a basis which, when coupled with the law, can result in a judgment. A court may decide whether the judgment being made will be partial or resolve all the issues in the case. On such a motion, there will often be oral argument at a hearing, particularly if the court, after looking at the written arguments, is disposed to grant the motion. At a trial all facts are found based on the evidence adduced, and the law is applied to the entirety of those facts resulting in a judgment being entered. At the appellate level, written arguments are submitted to the court in what are called ""briefs"" accompanied by pertinent parts of the record from the proceeding that is the sublect of the appeal. Then, the court will in many instances hear oral argument from the opposing sides. You should be aware that the hearing and oral argument phrases that you ask about are somewhat interchangeable, especially in casual conversation, even among lawyers."
1826615,"No. This is asking for trouble.  You are trying to profit by associating yourself and your images with a celebrity. It is irrelevant that the likeness would not be perfect.  You need to learn a hard lesson----any time you try to profit by associating your company or art work with famous celebrities, companies, trademarks, athletes, etc,  you are in all probability violating various IP laws, such as rights of publicity, privacy, trademark  law, trade dress law and unfair competition. We reward and protect people who do the hard work of creating original works, original brands, original celebrity status---etc..

2012166,"I am not familiar with this language in Michigan. According  to the brief research I completed on the topic.. Deferred adjudication is a form of plea deal available in various jurisdictions, where a defendant pleads ""guilty"" or ""No Contest"" to criminal charges in exchange for meeting certain requirements laid out by the court within an allotted period of time also ordered by the court. This is similar to what many Michigan courts call a delayed sentence. Meaning that your friend have violated the terms of an arrangement made in Texas and must be sentenced on the charge. Your friend should consult an attorney who practices in Texas to answer any questions."
1801465,"Yes, copying that information is a violation of copyright.  Furthermore, you are doing yourself a great dis-service by not contacting your own lawyer to help you get your ducks in a row.  The TOS is your contract with your visitors.  Using your own lawyer will allow you to make your visitors do what you want, and will shield you from many liabilities.  Here is what I tell my clients about their web sites:  There is much you need to know as you begin your new business.  Further, your web site will need legal policies.  I suggest you do not attempt to write your own legal policies.  This is not where your training and background lie, and though you are probably as smart as an attorney, you do not have their experience.   Below is a checklist for legal issues I use for new e-commerce clients.   1. Business Model ‰ÛÒ Is your idea viable as a web based business?  Do you have a business model written out?   2. Business entity - Are you going to be a C corp, a sub-S, an LLC or a sole proprietorship?  There are liability and tax issues that can dramatically affect how your business prospers and selecting the proper entity is a critical first step.   3. Terms of Service - This is your contract with your visitors and is the most important item for any e-commerce site. A little work here brings big dividends in the future.  The absence of a written ""Terms of Service"" can expose your business and possibly you to both criminal and civil liability.   4. Privacy Policy - Every e-commerce site needs a Privacy Policy!  Operating an e-commerce site without a Privacy Policy exposes you to civil and criminal liability.  Further, the absence of a Privacy Policy will cause a red flag for many legitimate visitors who will not deal a web site not professional enough to have a Privacy Policy.   5. FTC guidelines - The FTC has been regulating business advertising for almost a century.  All of their advertising guidelines apply to e-commerce sites. The FTC negotiates with established e-commerce businesses but new ones are frequently sanctioned with fines, etc.   6. Domain Name issues?  Is your name available?  Can you create a Trademark? Domain names, trademarks and service marks can become valuable assets but the failure to properly protect them may deprive you of much of their value.   7. Trademark - Do you have a brand name free from conflict? Should you start with just common law rights? When Should you register the mark?      8. Copyright - If it is on the web, it already belongs to somebody. Did you buy a license for the images you are using?  Using copyrighted materials without proper licensing  is not only expensive but under some conditions criminal.   9. Do you need a DMCA policy?  This is a very inexpensive ""insurance policy"" which gives you a ""safe harbor"" from liability if your visitors post copyright material on your web site.   10. Web Site security issues?  Ask Target, etc. if this is an issue.   11. Do you need and have an EIN? You can get that for free.  If your business is a corporation (C or S) you need an EIN.  Even if you‰Ûªre a single member LLC  or sole proprietorship, you‰Ûªll need an EIN to open your bank account.   12. Do you need an arbitration clause?  Arbitration is not always pleasant but it‰Ûªs cheaper and quicker than litigation.  Further, an arbitration clause will create a barrier against any class action being brought against you.   13. Do you have employees?  If so you need written policies regarding their authority and use of the internet.   This can be part of your employee manual.   14. Do you know the difference between a ""browser wrap"" and a ""click wrap"" and which do you need?   Using a click wrap will greatly decrease your liability.   15.   Are you abiding by the Child's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) rules?  There are serious repercussions if you run afoul of COPPA."

1794398,"Each divorce case is different.  There is no magic formula for determining how property is divided.  In fact, TN law provides 11 factors to be considered. They are:  (c) In making equitable division of marital property, the court shall consider all relevant factors including:     (1) The duration of the marriage;     (2) The age, physical and mental health, vocational skills, employability, earning capacity, estate, financial liabilities and financial needs of each of the parties;     (3) The tangible or intangible contribution by one (1) party to the education, training or increased earning power of the other party;     (4) The relative ability of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets and income;     (5)  (A) The contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation, appreciation, depreciation or dissipation of the marital or separate property, including the contribution of a party to the marriage as homemaker, wage earner or parent, with the contribution of a party as homemaker or wage earner to be given the same weight if each party has fulfilled its role;        (B) For purposes of this subdivision (c)(5), dissipation of assets means wasteful expenditures which reduce the marital property available for equitable distributions and which are made for a purpose contrary to the marriage either before or after a complaint for divorce or legal separation has been filed.     (6) The value of the separate property of each party;     (7) The estate of each party at the time of the marriage;     (8) The economic circumstances of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective;     (9) The tax consequences to each party, costs associated with the reasonably foreseeable sale of the asset, and other reasonably foreseeable expenses associated with the asset;     (10) The amount of social security benefits available to each spouse; and     (11) Such other factors as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties."

If she said, I think he is a bad parent, that is an opinion and not defamation."

1802536,"Assuming you work for a private employer and you are not under an employment contract, the answer is yes.   North Carolina is an ""at-will"" state, which means that a private employer can generally discharge a (i.e., fire) an employee for any reason or no reason at all.    While there laws that protect employees from being fired for certain prohibited reasons (e.g., race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability, retaliation), none of those  reasons appear to be relevant in your case.   With that being said, if they do end up firing you, you should nevertheless be entitled to your unemployment benefits.   Mind you, the Division of Employment Security may initially deny your claim for unemployment; however, if your claim is denied, you should appeal and ask for a hearing.  In my experience, based on the facts above, if argued correctly, you should be able to win your unemployment benefits."
1785749,"Your question contained the key words, ""even though they can't afford it.""  Here is what will likely happen.  The police will charge the criminals with as many crimes as they can justify and the prosecutor will prosecute them.  Restitution will likely be ordered in the criminal case requiring the thieves to pay you the amount of money that you lost.  You could also file a civil lawsuit against them, but if they cannot afford to pay, then it would likely be a waste of your time and money.  If the items' total value is less than $5,000, you can sue in small claims court to save yourself attorney's fees.

1799114,"You're under no obligation to act as a reference for this person to the bar association.  That is voluntary.  If you make false statements to the bar association about this person, then you would be liable for any defamatory remarks.  It sounds like this ""friend"" is merely worried that you might say something negative to the bar association that might affect their approval to become licensed.  If you have valid concerns about the person's character and wish to voice them to the bar, then I would caution you to speak only about facts and circumstances about which you have direct and corroborable knowledge.  The mere fact that the person is making these threats related to their admission to practice law sounds like a grounds to believe they are not of the good, moral character that the rest of us practitioners would aspire to, although I am not in possession of all of the facts, here.  Bottom line:  speak only the truth, and don't worry about being sued, because in a defamation case, the truth is an absolute defense.  It sounds like an empty threat from someone with personality issues.  And one last thing:  keep a record of any phone calls, emails or other messages you receive from this person in case you ever need to present them as evidence (either in your own defense, or as evidence of the person's bad character)."

If it were me, I would be the proactive adult, and get myself out of the situation.   Best of Luck."

Before I respond to your inquiry, I must state that we have not spoken, I have not reviewed the relevant documents and facts, and I do not represent you. Therefore, my discussion below is not a legal opinion, but is informational only. Finally, my discussion applies only to issues to which Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or Federal law applies.  That being said, I am very sorry to hear of your loss.  There is no right to sue under HIPAA; you may have a right to sue under state law for privacy violations.  If the violation was of your daughter's privacy, then you may not have standing to bring suit.  If it was of your privacy, then you may have a claim.    It is likely that the best action would be to file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights using the link that Attorney Candela provided; she gave you excellent advice.  Be aware, however, that no suit or complaint will bring you closure or justice on this issue.    /Christopher E. Ezold/"

If the defendant fails to pay the judgment voluntarily, then you have to pursue collections activities against the named defendant in the judgment, such as garnishments and liens.  So who is the judgment defendant?  If it is the individual people, the ""management"" then your claim is against that person, not the company. Is the Company a named defendant in the judgment?

A motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction would be in order, but that's tough for a pro se person to do and its easy to screw up.  A motion to register the California judgment is also a good idea, but which to file depends on your goals.  I have attached a link to the Missouri Supreme Court's web site.

1815268,"Staff attorneys with the SPD's Office and private attorneys who accept SPD appointed cases often take cases to trial.  You have an absolute right to a trial by jury.  You are the only one who can waive that right.  If you are not happy with the attorney you have, you may ask that attorney to withdraw from your case and request that a different attorney be appointed.  This, however, is not an unlimited option.  Once you have asked for a different attorney one or two times, expect the judge to tell you that if you fire the next one you will be representing yourself.  Also be aware that while YOU may think you have a good chance to win at trial, an experienced attorney might have a very different view of the case.  Attorneys know about the rules of evidence (what can come before the jury and what cannot).  Attorneys also know what generally works with a jury and what doesn't.  If your attorney is telling you that you don't have a very good case and you disagree, you may want to have a different attorney appointed so that you can get a second opinion.  If the next attorney doesn't think you have a very good case, you probably don't have a very good case.  That said, you still can tell your attorney that you want a trial.  Understand that the sentence you receive when you take a case to trial and lose, is usually not as good as the sentence you get by accepting a plea offer.  This is especially true when you elect to testify on your own behalf and the jury's verdict indicates that they didn't believe you.  In that case, the judge believes that you lied to the jury which is an indication of your character.  The character of the defendant is one of the main sentencing factors that the judge must consider when deciding your sentence."
1815811,"Yes, you must be legally married (or be registered domestic partners).  In addition to providing a marriage certificate (or registration), the person seeking to adopt will undergo a criminal background check; a court investigator will make a report/recommendation to the court; the child must be at least 10 years younger than the person seeking to adopt; and, a consent or termination of parental rights is required.  These are the highlights of the requirements and it is a good idea to speak with an attorney in your area for specifics of your situation and any additional local court rules that may apply should you become married."
1789471,"If you are looking for a recommendation of a good lawyer, I would speak to the Federal Defender's Office in Richmond, who can recommend good criminal defense lawyers in the area. If you are looking for someone to handle your 2255 for free, that is going to be hard to find.  Litigating a 2255 is a huge undertaking, especially when you have pleaded guilty. Essentially, you need a lawyer to prove that you are innocent but pleaded guilty anyway.  If you are unable to afford a lawyer to help you, you may have to file it yourself and ask the court to appoint counsel.  The court will only do so if your papers present a legitimate claim.  The 2255 is not drawn to a judge randomly. It goes back to the judge who handled your case originally.  Good luck."
1822553,"Mediation is a fairly informal conference where the parties meet (with attorneys if you have them) with a mediator who attempts to facilitate a settlement or agreement between the parties.  The only expectation is that you act professionally in discussing the issues of your case.  Your mediation notice likely has details about how long mediation lasts, and how much it might costs, and you could mediate together in the same room or with each of you in separate rooms.  The mediator does not make decisions and cannot give you legal advice.  Also, keep in mind that negotiations that take place in mediation and most discussions held in mediation are 100% confidential.  The 'jargon' basically says that in the event that you both reach an agreement, then either of you are responsible for submitting your agreement to the court for approval.  Mediation can be a good way of resolving your differences and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
1826946,"You are not obligated to sell it if you don't wish to. There are no rules about property abandoned to roommates. The landlord/tenant laws are written concerning property left with landlords. Of course, if you were entrusted with some property (i.e. the roommate told you to hold on to it while she was gone and you agreed) then you might be sued for conversion if you were to sell it and keep the money. If you do sell it, there are multiple other ways of getting money to her that do not involve Paypal or checks. I suggest checking with her before doing anything with the property. If she brings a claim against you, or you want to ensure that you handle the disposition of the property properly, consult with one of us directly."
1823847,"child support is the sole responsibility of the person owing it and as his new spouse, you should not be held responsible for it. You  need to consult with an attorney regarding the prenuptial and the home. You can sell your home and the proceeds you receive will be your separate property, but if you use the money from the sale and buy a home with your spouse to be and it is a joint ownership, then that money is no longer separate property...it has been comingled. I urge you to consult with an attorney so that you are protected before agreeing to anything."
1790170,"Since you are on the other side of the ""corporate veil,"" the creditor may be able to get at your corporation. The legal fiction of a corporate veil protects you personally from certain liabilities of your corporation, but it does not work the other way. If the creditor obtains a judgment against you personally, one of your assets would be your ownership interest in this corporation. If the creditor is able to get control of your shares, he or she essentially controls the assets of the corporation. And keep in mind that trying to transfer ownership or assets at this point may be considered a fraudulent conveyance. Talk to a litigation attorney (or several) to help you determine the proper course of action."
1823703,"Deficiency judgments are allowed in Maine, as they are in Florida where I practice.  I would not even consider closing on a short sale unless the lender issues a deficiency waiver in writing prior to closing.  Otherwise, bankruptcy may be a better option.  You might also want to consult a professional about the possible tax consequences of short sale in your case."
1807451,"Frankly, I recommend NOT putting it in a bank account.  Once it is in a bank account, which is generally not protected, the rule against garnishing against the SSA, your moneys, doesn't apply, since SSA no longer has those moneys, but you do in YOUR account.  While there are rules now that tell a bank to double check where the money came from, banking employees are known to err in that - being human and all.  Moreover, only a certain amount may be legally protected nonetheless, such as 2 months worth of benefits.  If I were you, and have judgements (or even pre judgment creditors) I'd use the SSA's debit card to receive and hold my benefits:  USDirectExpress.com."
1817615,"A settlement in workers' compensation can take on multiple forms.  If you are referring to what is known as a section 32 settlement, the insurance carrier may demand that you waive your right to future medical benefits as well as your weekly payments.  The amount of the settlement depends on multiple factors, and also depends to a certain extent on whether you are collecting social security benefits and are medicare eligible.  However, a settlement can also simply be a stipulation regarding permanency.  In your situation, you and the carrier may agree to a certain percentage of permanency, which would not effect your right to future medical care.  However, your case is complicated somewhat by the fact that you have a serious leg injury.  As such, your permanency could either take the form of a percentage loss of use, or in the alternative, a classification.  A classification will also require a determination regarding your loss of wage earning capacity, which in turn determines how much you will receive per week and for how long.  Obviously, these are fairly complex issues, and I would suggest that you consult with an attorney who specializes in workers' comp matters."
1798166,"Be sure that when the issues is presented to a Judge, that you provide comprehensive information about your work history, finances, medical condition-in short, anything that will impact on the Court's determination of both child and spousal support.  Also, usually this information needs to be provided in advance.  If you are going to represent yourself because of cost factors, you might still want to consult with an attorney just to obtain some guidance and advice, and some procedural guidance.  You will need to comply with the Court rules regarding the provision of information and evidence to the other side and the Court."

1800314,"I practice in Stillwater.  What you should do depends on 2 things.  First, which time is up?  Either your ""requirement"" date or your ""off deferred"" date?  If it is your requirement date, then you should contact your probation (either DA or Okla Court Services) and show them proof of what you have done (including your 1/2 completed and paid for ADSAC), they will usually extend your requirement date upon this showing.  If it is your off date, your attorney may attend in your absence and request an extension of the off date - to try and prevent the bench warrant from being issued, (this gets tricky).  In some cases, a bench warrant can be recalled (for example if you complete your probation requirements) but it is easier if it never gets issued to begin with.   I'm wondering how you are currently taking ADSAC while in South Carolina - my understanding is that this course is only offered in Oklahoma."
1803629,"You could withdraw the I-140 by writing to USCIS, and apply for a change of status from H1B to B2.  You can stay here while the change of status is being decided, which will take 2.5 months.  So even if it is denied, you will get the time you need.  If it is denied, you must depart immediately to avoid unlawful presence.  If you leave before it is decided, you don't need to do anything, since it will be deemed abandoned.  An attorney can investigate these options further with you and make sure your papers leave you in a good position to get a tourist visa in the future."
1787284,"First, let me say how sickening and sad it is to hear stories of abuse against innocent children.   Determining if the daycare can be held liable for the employee's acts turns, in part, on whether the employee was acting negligently or intentionally.  It is difficult to hold an employer responsible for the intentional acts of their employees that are not within the scope of their employment.  If the child sustained the injures due to the employee's negligence rather than intentional conduct, then daycare may be held liable.  Also, an argument could me made that the daycare was negligent in the hiring/retention and/or supervision of this caregiver.   Whether those facts exist is unknown from your post.  If no such facts exist, you may be left with a claim against the employee only.  If the employee did indeed act intentionally there may be no insurance coverage for her actions.  The parents of the child should contact an attorney to discuss the merits of the claim."
1812760,"You can definitely file for a new E-2 using another employer. If you are applying at the consulate, the processing time will depend on how quickly you get the attorney the documents they need to prepare the case and how quickly you or your attorney can schedule an interview.

Please call your attorney and schedule an appointment to discuss these issues and next steps.  Anyone on this site, clearly does not have the knowledge of the events that your lawyer does.  I will offer one fact, guardianships are fluid.  The fact that something was denied once does not mean that if there is a change in circumstance or additional facts are learned that similar issues may be addressed again by the court.  That being said the court can always consider a termination petition.  Again, PLEASE discuss this with YOUR attorney.  Best of luck to you."
1791643,"If you get married, your spouse would have to wait approximately two years from the time you file your I-130 petition until a visa number will be available for her to come to the U.S.  She cannot stay here all that time on a visitor's visa, which is usually only for six months'  stay in the U.S.  It will also be impossible for her to get a visitor's visa (or legally extend her stay if she is already here) after she is married to you because it will be clear that she intends to immigrate and is not just visiting."
1792724,"Each independent alleged violation of probation is enough to cause a probationer to be sentenced to the statutory maximum that s/he could have received when s/he was first placed on probation.  There will be a hearing held. If the judge decides by a preponderance of the evidence that a probationer willfully and substantially violated any material term of the probation then the probationer can (and will) be sentenced from a low of reinstatement to a high of whatever the statutory maximum punishment could have been before the probationer accepted probation.  Your b/f's best bet at minimizing his exposure is to have a seasoned and skilled criminal defense litigator efforting on his behalf. Thus...   My advise: Locate an experienced 813 area criminal defense lawyer, engage in a meaningful consultation and get yourself some advise which is legally sound and has been custom tailored as possible to meet his specific reasonable needs in his unique case.

If you have questions after reviewing the documents, you may want to consult with a real estate attorney for more information."
1816404,"It is unclear that your payment of the mortgage and ""upkeep payments"" gave you any interest in the property, equitable or otherwise. It is equally unclear the ""many reasons"" the property was never titled in your name.   You may be able to establish a constructive trust in the proceeds if you can establish an agreement with your father that you had an interest in the property. The fact you did not do so for 15 years is against you, as well as the fact, apparently, you do not have a written agreement which establishes your interest in the house.  The mere fact the property has sold should not affect any interest you have in the proceeds from the sale, although once the proceeds are disbursed to your father he will have funds to fight your efforts.   Bottom line: you will need an attorney to prosecute your claim and sufficient funds to do it. Good luck."

1815606,"From what you describe, I would recommend hiring an attorney. I do not know what kind of litigation is involved, so I cannot get too far into specifics. In general, if you have the original documents, and the other side is offering edited copies, there are three steps for you t take. First, you will need to submit the originals, supporting the offer of evidence with testimony (live or by affidavit, depending on the circumstances) showing that they are the originals, how they have been maintained, and how they were obtained. The second step is to move to strike the evidence offered by the other side using the Original Source Rule (see Rules of Evidence 1000 and following). The final step is to ask the court for sanctions on the basis of spoliation of evidence, which means tampering with evidence while litigation is anticipated or pending. This step is only appropriate if the other side really did change the documents. Good luck."
1789847,"Unfortunately it is hard to sort through the players and what they did in your question.  However the subjects of your question are  voyeurism, disseminating voyeuristic material and misappropriation.    You may have a claim here, but it would be helpful if you posted a comment on this question to clarify 1) who had their picture taken 2) if the person who took the picture had permission, 3) who took the picture, and 4) if the Facebook page is used for business.   Contact a Connecticut attorney who handles personal injury cases.  Since two of the ""wrongs"" here are crimes, you can also file a complaint with your local police department.  In the meantime you can read about the law in my answer.  VOYEURISM: Under Conn. Gen. Stat. å¤ 53a-189a. Taking a picture of someone 1) with malice, 2) without that person's  knowledge and consent, 3) while that person is NOT in plain view and 4) under circumstances where that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy is voyeurism.  For you to sue, or for the State to prosecute under this statute, it would have to be proven that the subject of the photo had a reasonable expectation of privacy in order to prove voyeurism and that the photo was taken with malice.  Malice: To act ""with malice"" means to act with some improper or unjustifiable or harmful motive including, but not limited to, the desire to cause pain, injury or distress to another.  Privacy: A person has a reasonable expectation of privacy when (he/she) has shown a subjective expectation of privacy and the expectation is one that society considers reasonable.  The subject of the photograph may be able to get past malice and privacy by showing that he did not want the photograph taken that after asking to have the photo removed from Facebook, the photographer refused.  Voyeurism is a class D felony and caries up to 5 years in prison.  DISSEMINATING VOYEURISTIC MATERIAL: Conn. Gen. Stat. å¤ 53a-189b the photographer who posted and refused to remove the photo from Facebook might be guilty of the class D felony of disseminating voyeuristic material.  The subject of the photo could sue under these statutes.  MISAPPROPRIATION:  When the subject of a photograph who's photograph is used in an advertisement without his consent files suit and asks for punitive damages, he must prove malice reckless indifference to the rights of others or intentional and wanton violation of those rights to recover damages. Venturi v. Savitt, 468 A.2d 933 (Conn. 1983).  Misappropriation can occur when a photo is used, without the subject‰Ûªs permission, for advertising purposes. Korn v. Rennison, 156 A.2d 476 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1959).  Again--you will need to hire an attorney.  Since two of the ""wrongs"" here are crimes, you can also file a complaint with your local police department."
1805893,"I would discuss this situation with another attorney and see whether your perceptions are reasonable and fair.  Sometimes when presented with a litigation situation, there may be many possible responses and tactical maneuvers one could take given enough time, creativity and thought.    Some of these responses may not be immediately apparent, and perhaps you may not have asked the right questions and your attorney may have not exhaustively done research on the finer legal points of the claims or facts, nor may there have been money in your budget, retainer agreement or scope of services for his to pursue some ""leave no stones unturned approach"".  The question may hinge on whether an attorney of normal expertise in this area WOULD HAVE or SHOULD HAVE known about this option which now seems to have been feasible.  Hindsight is always 20:20.  Clients may not appreciate that many tactical responses in legal conflicts are far from clearcut, and might not be listed in some laws or commonly available ""checklists"".  The fact that your attorney did refund part of the retainer could indicate that he is trying to be fair with you and ""meet you halfway"" or that he did make the big whoopsie you are accusing him of and is making a refund in the hopes you'll go away quietly and not pursue action against him.  You should speak with a different attorney and get a feel for how an action for malpractice or sanctions would work out for you.  If the error is not blatant, and there are some ""grey areas"", probably not well.  For you to prove malpractice, you have to show that BUT FOR the attorney's error, you would have certainly won a case you lost.  Quite frankly, from what you are saying, I have doubts you could meet that burden."
1791967,"There is no ""accused"" yet until an arrest is made. Constitutional rights of discovery and due process will not become ripe for claim until the government has made an actual arrest. If an arrest is made, the defendant will have rights to discovery, which will include affidavits for search warrant, warrants, statements, etc. If this person believes he is being targeted for investigation, he should obtain an attorney immediately."
1794666,"Your post boils down to -""I think my attorney did not do his job, what do I do"".  With so little in the way of facts or details, the most meaningful advice would be for you to take all your case documents to another attorney for a complete analysis of your situation, including whether or not you have any cause of action against your attorney, ie in the form of a complaint you could file against the bar association or in terms of a law suit for malpractice."

Under Arizona Department of Corrections  - Department Order Manual i911.06 beginning on page 25. It can be found on the web.  It includes the causes for suspensions; time maximums for suspension depending on the reason for it; and the appeals process procedures.  I believe you have correctly taken the first step in the request for lifting the suspension process.  The first step is to write a letter to the Warden or Unit Deputy Warden.  If you know the reason for suspension, you can explain your side of the story, including in steps you have taken assure there will be no future misunderstandings.  After the Warden reviews it, he then must send it on to the ADC Regional Operations Director, to make the decision.  You should receive a letter or documentation which outlines their decision as to whether or not the suspension will be reversed and the grounds for their decision if it will not be.  There should also be an appeals process if you do not agree with the decision included in the manual.   If it has been more than 30 days since you wrote the letter to the Warden, I would suggest you send a second request. Attach your original letter to the second request, in case the first was not received, or lost in the mail. Check to make sure the addressee information is current and correct.  I imagine it is difficult for both of you.  But try to be patient with the process.  I hope it works out for you.   I've added the link to the Arizona Department of Corrections - Department Order Manual.  I hope you find this helpful."
1792333,"Great questions and I certainly would like answers, too.  Hire an attorney and have him or her request the police report.  You may not receive the police report until the arraignment.

So you have to look at the net picture! $2700 is not a significant amount frankly and you may expend that much gambling on lottery to earn it. Good luck. Speak to your attorney if you have one also and advise them in writing."

1803506,"The L1A petition isn't something people do after asking the internet. You have a foreign corporation (that has been operating for at least 3 years) and a US sister company that operates under specific ownership and management requirements. And you have to prove it in the application. And the person who is to come, must have worked abroad for the corporation for a year. I'm guessing that the companies aren't posting this - the candidate is. In which case, remember it is the company that applies and the company that hires it's lawyers. You may want to consult with someone on your own for independent advice. Lawyers hired by companies to do an L1 can be very expensive even for a 1 hour session. And it wouldn't be in confidence. Good luck"
1826625,"I strongly urge you to hire a patent attorney ASAP as your question reflects that you do not understand the reasons for the filing of a provisional application and what is required to be included.  The simple answer is that if you want to cover an invention, you need to file a complete provisional application (i.e. one with ALL of the necessary information, language and description) -- otherwise, you will not have what you call ""prior art advantage."" If someone uses B and only B is claimed in the utility patent application arising from the provisional application, then the answer is, most likely, yes.  If someone uses B+C and B was before and C was after, then B+C possibly could be used as prior art against your application.  Without reviewing the exact facts and circumstances, no patent attorney can really assist you.  Good luck.  A patent attorney anywhere in the country can help you."

2022674,"Speak with your lawyer.  You just pled guilty and now you want to undo it?  Probably won't work.  The DMV and court are totally separate.  You seem confused by the outcome of your case and I'm not clear on what your attorney did.  The blood alcohol level of .07 was probably listed on your plea form by agreement with the DA since you were pleading to ""wet"" and to ensure you only have to do the 12 hour class.  The court has ordered the class NOT the DMV."

If the reason you were not given the raise is BECAUSE of any characteristic you have which is in a protected class (age over 40, race, religion, gender, pregnancy, disability, etc.) you may have a case for unlawful discrimination.   Otherwise, as the other responses state, as an at-will employee (no written contract for hiring an employee for a specified time), your employer is only legally required to pay you minimum wage (in CA $9.00 per hour currently) and any overtime if you are a nonexempt employee."

Not the least of which is what happens if you renege on your agreement to sell your house.  If that contract was entered into after you filed your bankruptcy, your bankruptcy will not protect you from a breach of contract suit and may cost you A LOT of money.

1816554,You are dealing with a case involving the Uniform custody act which all states have adopted.  There is a procedure in that statute that details the documents you have to file in your new state and the requirements for serving the father of the children.  He has a chance to object to the transfer of jurisdiction and the judges from the two states will then make findings as to which state should deal with any future custody/parenting time issues.  This is a complicated area of the law and an experience attorney needs to be involved for you.
333279,"A parent's liability for the support of his or her children is limited to children under the age of 21 years. In the absence of an express or implied contract, parents have no duty to support an adult child after he or she turns 21. It is unnecessary to go to court to terminate child support under that circumstance; termination is automatic. For custody, visitation and other purposes, the age of majority is age 18, but for purposes of the child support obligation the age of majority remains at 21."

1805358,"If he does not return your son then you need to file for and get an ex parte pick up order from a judge.  Ex parte means that the father has no knowledge of it, so he cannot move your son if he knows you are coming.   Once the ex parte pick order is granted, you will need to present it to the local law enforcement agency where your son is.  They will review the order and then go with you to pick up the child.  Without a specific ex parte pick up order, the police will not get involved. If you just present them court papers showing you are the residential parent, they will just consider it a civil matter.  You need an ex parte pick up order. All states, with the exception of MA, follow the UCCJEA regarding this.  MA just requires one extra step, which is for a local judge to review the ex parte pick up order.  It is best to retain an attorney to file this for you and argue it to the judge. If you child remains out of the State of Florida for six months, Florida can lose jurisdiction over your child."

You, however, will not need any new (or ""fresh"" as you would call it) ""stamping"" just for having transferred employers.  If you decide to depart as well and accompany your wife abroad, upon your return you will still be admitted on your still valid H-1B visa stamp, despite the fact that it was issued with your former employer's name on it.  All you'll need to do is have the copy of 3 most recent pay stubs issued you by the new employer, as well as a letter confirming employment by the current employer addressed to the CBP at the airport you intend to land at when flying back to the US.

1804304,"Your mother would have received a life estate on the house no matter your age at the time of his death under homestead statutes. They have since revised the statutes to allow a wife to receive a 50% share; however, I think that revision happened after your father's death. In any event, upon reaching the age of 18, you can quit claim to your mother any rights you have in the property. If you were the only child this should allow her to sell the home. For title purposes, a better plan may be to have her place the property for sale and then when the home is sold you sign the deed of transfer in addition to your mother. It is between you and your mother as to whether or not you receive any of the proceeds for the sale. I do not suggest you do any deeds on your own. You should consult an attorney in your area to prepare the correct documentation or have the closing company do so at the time the home is sold."

Since this is something an experienced elder law attorney would have discussed with you, I am assuming you are trying to do this without the benefit of competent counsel. Don't try to do it on your own. The problems you create for yourself and your mother aren't worth the money you think you might save trying to avoid the attorney.

1813608,"Mr. Gibney, the other lawyer who has answered this question, despite the handicap of a Florida Law License, has given you a fine answer.  My answer will serve only to give some Alabama flavor to his.  Getting the other parent's consent to the adoption is very important in Alabama.  While it is possible to terminate parental rights based on a failure to provide support and a failure to maintain reasonable contact with the child, it's difficult.  The non-custodial parent always tries to blame the custodial parent for cutting off the relationship or interfering.  This gets messy.  So it's much cleaner if the father consents to the adoption.  A real incentive for the father to consent to the adoption would be the prospect avoiding child support.  If your husband adopts the child, the father no longer has a support obligation!    I need to emphasize one other thing that Mr. Gibney said:  Get a lawyer. Don't try to do this alone.  There are too many ways it can get screwed up."

The car belongs to whoever is named on the current title (plus whoever that title is signed over to).  New Jersey also requires you to re-title the vehicle in your name right after you buy it.  If you did not do that, you are in violation of New Jersey law.    Do you have a contract of sale with either party?  I guess not.  Which basically means that nobody is in a good situation.  Your attorney will advise you how to minimize your damage - you won't get out of this without spending money now.  If you don't have an attorney, one of us here would be able to help you.

See https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204010. The exception would be if you waited too long to file for benefits after an approval. Typically a child has 6 months after the Notice of Award to apply for benefits without losing potential benefits.  So if you applied for benefits for your son within 6 months of your son's father being approved, you should be entitled to past-due benefits. If it were more than 6 months after the Notice of Award, you would not receive the retroactive benefits.   If you cannot get Social Security to acknowledge the mistake, you should ask your child's father for a copy of his Social Security Disability application, and take a copy of the the webpage I linked above to your Social Security office, along with the receipt showing when your filed for the dependent's benefit. If Social Security still indicates that you are not due the additional money, I would recommend contacting your United States Representative or United States Senator for help."

1800261,"I believe you need to speak with an attorney. The claim you have is not a real estate claim, but a breach of contract claim and possible consumer fraud claim. That the contractor took your money, and has not completed the work is a per se violation of the consumer fraud act, especially if there is no written agreement, or if the time limits called for in the contract have not been complied with. You should speak with an attorney experienced in the area of consumer fraud and have a frank discussion about what your options might be in the circumstances. Good luck"

It is simply too serious to be discussing on the internet with strangers.  Also, please do not post any information that can be used to identify you, nor anything else about what happened; since the police are involved there is the possibility that you might be accused of something criminal, in which case anything you've posted, whether true or not, could be used against you."

Only so called ""wobblers"" can be reduced to a misdemeanor (these are crimes that could have been charged as a felony or misdemeanor). If the crime is a straight felony (which I believe yours are) they cannot be reduced. Also, if you were sentenced to state prison,  you cannot reduce your conviction, even if it was a wobbler.

With respect to probate and the credit cards:  One of the main purposes of probate is to make sure creditors get paid.  If the probate process starts, you will be obligated to list all debts and to notify the creditors.  However, once the creditor claim period has passed, creditors can no longer make a claim on probate assets.  If I were in your situation I might just sit tight for a few months to wait and see if the credit card companies do anything about the unpaid credit card bills ... but make sure you keep the truck and boats off the road and water so there are no accidents while you are waiting.   The first priority creditors are the funeral home, the estate Administrator and the lawyer.  That could eat up much of the value of the estate, leaving the credit card companies with little reason to pursue their claims once the probate estate is opened, but if you wait six months they will be too late with their claims."
1791640,"Yes, you disclose the losses. It would be a crime not to.   By itself, having gambling losses is not a basis for denial of discharge. The issue is whether you used credit (e.g. cash advances off of credit cards) to gamble. Careful planning and strategy can usually overcome these issues and allow you to have a successful bankruptcy. These can be complex cases that take a lot of time, so don't expect a cheap bankruptcy."
1794821,"Apparently you are claiming that someone else took out a PPO against you, then called your employer to make slanderous charges against you, resulting in actual damages to you.  This is the very sort of case that can be the basis of a complaint for slander.  Of course, there are problems of proof because, as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, you would have the burden of proving that the statements made by the person you are suing were false.  There also may be problems of collecting a judgment if you get it, because if the person you are suing is broke it may be difficult to collect.  I believe you should consult with a lawyer right away to look into your options and take action if it appears you have a chance of winning and collecting on a judgment large enough to be worthwhile for you and the attorney,"

1551174,"You're going to have to list both in the lawsuit, but insurance companies don't pay out easily.  Especially commercial/employer insurance companies.  I live and work in California and deal with accidents like yours all the time, so I am happy to answer your question. Your gut instinct is right that you have questions regarding your rights and your case. I've handled a good amount of accident cases and know that insurance companies give cases like yours a hard time even if the police report finds the other person at fault. You should hire an attorney now before you hurt your case (happens unfortunately very often). You should hire a lawyer to help you out with the claim because regardless of the outcome of the police report insurance companies give unrepresented people a tough time. I've handled cases and referred clients to great doctors in the San Bernardino, CA area.   At our firm we always refer clients to all kinds of doctors and chiropractors when our clients are injured and our clients never pay anything upfront, not even a copay. The doctors are willing to do this because an attorney is on board. You are entitled to have your property damage, medical bills and future medical expenses PAID FOR BY THE OTHER PARTY'S INSURANCE (or your uninsured motorist policy). The attorney you hire will handle the claims process from start to finish.   But you are going to need to see a specliast to even get a shot at getting future medical treatment from the Defenedant. Moreover it sounds like the accident is completely the other persons fault so you don't want this case to become a difficult one because of lack of inattention. The insurance company will make you believe that your case is worth very little... Regarding pain and suffering, you need to speak to an experienced attorney that can strategize your case. Just because you were in an accident doesn't mean you have pain and suffering, at least thats what the insurance companies think. Make no doubt about it you have a great case, but you need help from a professional. You are entitled to your medical bills being covered as well.   Do you feel that you are at the same medical condition that you were before the accident? As a basic premise I wouldn't handle your claim by yourself. The attorney you hired can likely refer you to a doctor, if you ask for one, who will see you with no upfront payment! I've done this many times to help my clients out. You should not wait a single day to hire a lawyer, we will advise you on the strategy of your case. There is no upfront cost to hire an attorney.   With a case like yours it seems like you have some good facts in order to get a high settlement, but your case definitely needs to be developed further to corroborate your story. The most important thing when building your case are: liability (were you at fault); how bad are your injuries to your body. A lot of these things sound like they are not complete yet in your case so its something that is worth hiring an attorney for in order to get a sense of whether you have a case and what the strategy would be for you to build a strong case! I've handled cases and/or spoken to clients in the San Bernardino, CA area.   Its very possible that your case is worth more than the $$$ that the insurance company will offer you by yourself. Make your life easier and call an attorney today, you won't regret it."
1815326,"Is the parking lot private property? If so, than the running at large provision probably doesn't apply. I would need to look at the police report and any statements to see what exactly was the basis for the charge. You should hire an attorney to assist you.

1795226,"You have already raised several issues here that will affect how long this person is facing - the main two are: 1. past record, and 2. probation.  Fel. Maintaining is a Class I felony and Fel. PWISD MDA is a class H felony.  The maximum sentence is 24 months and 39 months respectively, so the maximum time he is facing is 63 months in the Department of Adult Corrections or Prison.  However, several factors come into play as to what he will actually get and more information is required to answer that.  First would be the number of record level points he has, as the sentence changes from level to level.  Two, an additional point can be assigned for violating his probation. Three, another point can be assigned for similar charges on his record, if any.  As you can see, all of those have the potential of affecting his record and therefore his punishment.  Since he does have a prior history, he will be eligible for no less than a minimum of a Level 2 punishment, which carries a minimum of 3-13 and 4-14 months respectively, although those are both minimum sentences, and he is more than likely to receive a higher punishment than that.  The other issues in sentencing involve whether or not he pleads or is convicted of both charges, and whether or not they are sentenced concurrently or consecutively.  If concurrently, he will only serve one sentence, although usually the higher level charge."

1821997,"1) Is it necessary to hire a lawyer who specialize in ecommerce when I create my own website for my own business?   As someone who does a lot of work for websites, I think the experience can be quite helpful, and that makes it both cheaper and more efficient for you. However, a lawyer may not be the best investment of limited funds. While lawyers are valuable and important, an accountant or at least bookkeeper would be your first stop.  2) what kind of service does an ecommerce lawyer provide?   We can provide advice on things like privacy notices (required in California), terms of service, help with copyright and trademark issues, and many, many other things.  3) what is the price range for the service?   A lawyer with experience in the area will charge at least $250 an hour, up to as much as $600 an hour.   4) can I hire a lawyer from a different state than Where my business registers/operates?  I am a California lawyer, so I have a conflict of interest, but I would have my concerns about how much the lawyer from a different state knows about California law -- and they probably cannot practice here anyway. There is no advantage to being cheaper if he or she doesn't know the law.  There are a lot of great lawyers in the Bay Area that know a lot about ecommerce and other issues with being online. Meet with two or three who give free consultations to see who you feel most comfortable with."

The exact amount varies depending on the charge, whether jail time is imposed, and whether you have a court-appointed attorney, just to name a few variables."
1821685,"First, Maryland confers absolute immunity on witnesses in judicial proceedings.  Hunckel v. Voneiff, 69 Md. 179, 187-188 (1888).  So absolute is the privilege that it applies even when the witness making the allegedly defamatory statements does so maliciously, despite known falsity, or under otherwise unreasonable conduct.  Reichardt v. Flynn, 374 Md. 361, 367 (2003).  Further, Maryland follows the minority rule, which recognizes the privilege irrespective of the statement‰Ûªs relevance to the proceeding.  Reichardt, 374 Md. at 367.  Second, Maryland has extended testimonial immunity to ancillary statements in judicial proceedings, which now include: to include: statements made by witnesses in the courtroom during the course of trial, Korb v. Kowaleviocz, 285 Md. 699, 704 (1979); statements contained in pleadings, affidavits, or documents related to litigation, Keys v. Chrystler Credit Corp., 303 Md. 397, 403-404 (1985);  and statements prepared for possible use in an action, but not actually introduced, Adams v. Peck, 288 Md. 1 (1980).  Lastly, Maryland has extended the absolute testimonial privilege to administrative and non-judicial proceedings subject to a two-prong test iterated in Gersh v. Ambrose, 291 Md. 188, 197 (1981): (1) the nature of the public function of the proceeding; and (2) the adequacy of the procedural safeguards which will minimize the occurrence of the defamatory statements.  Since that test was created by in 1981, it has been discussed and applied by the Maryland Court of Appeals six times: Miner v. Novotny, 304 Md. 164 (1985)(false complaint of police brutality absolutely privileged); McDermott v. Hughley, 317 Md. 12 (1989)(report by psychiatrist to employer not privileged); Odyniec v. Schneider, 322 Md. 520 (1991)(false allegations of medical malpractice absolutely privileged); Imperial v. Drapeau, 351 Md. 38 (1998)(false allegations of medical malpractice against EMT absolutely privileged); Reichardt v. Flynn, 374 Md. 361, 367 (2003)(complaints of sexual misconduct against teacher absolutely privileged); and Smith v. Daneilczyk, 400 Md. 98 (2007)(false statements made in search warrant not privileged).  As you can see, the jurisprudence is nuanced, and factually driven.  I highly recommend that you consult with an attorney."
1823430,"Q: ""Can I use journal articles on a topic to develop web application based on them ... ."" R: Depends on what you mean by ""use.""    If you mean that the articles simply describe a web application and you intend to write the code for and brand that application then, yes, you can lawfully ""use"" the articles for that purpose [so long as you do not copy anyone else's code or infringe anyone else's trade dress or patent, if any, that protects that or a similar application].   If you mean that you want to literally re-publish the articles or parts of them or create an application that embodies parts of them then, no, you may not lawfully do any of those activities without a license from the owners of the copyright in those articles.   You need to speak with an intellectual property attorney before you pursue this business plan. Good luck."

1763957,"Look, I'm not going to type the many - the plethora - of viable explanations that I guarantee you that the cop in question will swear to on a busload of Bishops and a Cardinal too boot.    So you got a ticket(s) and now it is time to fight it.  If the end game was receipt of an infraction(s)  then any of the many local Z-hills area traffic lawyers can competently handle your case and if it turned into more, a criminal traffic or other criminal matter, then you might seek more experienced criminal defense counsel.  Either way, you can do this alone (foolishly I might add) or you can hire a lawyer to assist you.    You may or may not enjoy viable defenses to the charges, affirmative or otherwise, or there may be factual, legal, procedural or substantive mechanisms by which to attack and beat the charges in your unique case, but the best way for you to get competent advise is going to be to consult with an experienced and local traffic / criminal defense lawyer who can follow-up on your information with questions of her/his own, as well as review the citation(s) / police report(s) and whatever evidence that you may provide and then offer an informed opinion.   What you think or believe may or may not be relevant to what will happen in Court.  Please do yourself a favor and let someone with adequate training and knowledge help you to make that call.  Btw, if we are talking about infraction / non-criminal matters only then, in my opinion, the best defense for any traffic citation anywhere is to hire a local traffic ticket lawyer.  I can't speak to the Z-hills area per se but in Miami, Fl, where I have been a practicing criminal defense lawyer for 22+ years, for $49-$99 you will get a lawyer who knows the law, the procedure, the Judge and probably the cop.  In short you will almost certainly get both competent representation and a better result for a relatively small fee / investment.    I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."
1812226,"A car can only be ""repo'd""  if the creditor has a security interest in the car, usually documented by a title lien. If your girlfriend's creditors sue her and obtain judgments, those judgments will then become a security interest against all her property as a judicial lien.  But they are NOT a security interest her property until they do sue her and obtain judgment.  As Mr. O'Brien pointed out, it simply doesn't make sense for the creditor to spend more money to obtain pennies against a debt. Medical bills are especially vulnerable to being discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore medical creditors usually are very receptive to any reasonable payment plan proposed by the debtor."

It would likely be simply titled something like ""Promotional Book Character Participation Program Agreement"" or such and include the appropriate clauses. That might cost you $500-$1000, but will be a great investment as you could use it again and again in future promotions with minor customization, again done by an attorney and preferably the same ones so you do not have to pay for a new attorney to learn your business. You should not even think of trying to do that on your own. You were, I think, quite smart to know that you need attorney advice and to come here to get it. Now be smart and realize that what you need is SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE attorney advice based on the specific facts. If you maintain an ongoing relationship with a good attorney, the cost of each individual item will generally continually drop as the attorney becomes more familiar with your needs and you become more adept at expressing what you need and as more and more basic forms are created which can be used for future work. So, start now, pick wisely, and then if the attorney is good stick with that attorney for the long haul. You will be glad you did."

Typically, unless an employee has an employment contract, or is employed under a collective bargaining agreement through a union, the employer can modify or terminate the employment at any time with or without cause. An employer can alter schedules, compensation, and other the terms of employment for any non-discriminatory reason.  However, an employer generally cannot alter or terminate employment for prohibited discriminatory reasons (such as racial discrimination), or in retaliation for certain protected actions (such as whistle-blowing).  The description of the situation which you have provided does not include the elements of prohibited discrimination.

1810412,I do not believe that parole-in-place makes your wife eligible for a social security card because it is not accompanied with an employment authorization document.

1801076,"First, the personal liability will be discharged. However, the secured status will NOT change by you filing bankruptcy. It will still attach to your house. Sorry for the bad news. Thus, eventually, if there is equity (value minus 1st mortgage - remaining to protect 2nd mortgage) the 2nd mortgage will eventually possibly foreclose! If the value of house is LESS than 1st mortgage then you could do a ch 13 to avoid the 2nd mortgage. Or if close, you could possibly negotiate with 2nd mortgage to possibly try and reduce it too in a  ch 7. Good luck.   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

1813675,"In PA, there is no guarantee of alimony.  Here are the factors the court considers determining alimony:  In determining whether alimony is necessary and in determining the nature, amount, duration and manner of payment of alimony, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including: (1)  The relative earnings and earning capacities of the parties. (2)  The ages and the physical, mental and emotional conditions of the parties. (3)  The sources of income of both parties, including, but not limited to, medical, retirement, insurance or other benefits. (4)  The expectancies and inheritances of the parties. (5)  The duration of the marriage. (6)  The contribution by one party to the education, training or increased earning power of the other party. (7)  The extent to which the earning power, expenses or financial obligations of a party will be affected by reason of serving as the custodian of a minor child. (8)  The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage. (9)  The relative education of the parties and the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking alimony to find appropriate employment. (10)  The relative assets and liabilities of the parties. (11)  The property brought to the marriage by either party. (12)  The contribution of a spouse as homemaker. (13)  The relative needs of the parties. (14)  The marital misconduct of either of the parties during the marriage. The marital misconduct of either of the parties from the date of final separation shall not be considered by the court in its determinations relative to alimony, except that the court shall consider the abuse of one party by the other party. As used in this paragraph, ""abuse"" shall have the meaning given to it under section 6102 (relating to definitions). (15)  The Federal, State and local tax ramifications of the alimony award. (16)  Whether the party seeking alimony lacks sufficient property, including, but not limited to, property distributed under Chapter 35 (relating to property rights), to provide for the party's reasonable needs. (17)  Whether the party seeking alimony is incapable of self-support through appropriate employment.  There are many factors to consider in a divorce.

To avoid next month's rent, you must deliver written notice of termination not later than the 11th day of this month when this month is a 31-day month, or not later than the 10th day of this month when this month is a 30-day month. And, of course, you have to be completely out of the unit by midnight on the last calendar day of this month. There could be exceptions in particular fact situations, but developing those exceptions could involve more attorney fees than can be justified by the problem. Even when the departing tenant has not given enough notice, the landlord can't just sit around and let the unit remain unrented. The landlord is required to mitigate the problem by re-renting, or trying to re-rent. If a new tenant is procured right away, the landlord can't charge the whole month against the departing tenant."

1792475,"Any case involving the resolution of questions of federal constitutional law, in a proper case, come before the Supreme Court of the United States.  Decisions of state courts of last resort that decide questions on the meaning and application of federal laws, regulations and the Constitution all are within the pool of potentially interesting matters for the Court.  Review is sought by the filing, in the US Supreme Court, of a petition for a writ of certiorari to the California Supreme Court.  In Hill v. Colorado, I filed such a petition twice; in the first instance, the petition sought review of a decision against my clients by the Colorado Court of Appeals; in the second instance, after the Colorado Court of Appeals decision was vacated by the US Supreme Court, the Colorado Supreme Court also ruled against my clients, and I filed a second such petition.  There are a number of considerations governing review at the Supreme Court.  These are quite important and inform judgments by experienced counsel about seeking such review.  The first such consideration is the one you raised:  does the matter raise an issue of federal law (statutory, regulatory, or constitutional)?  Where a state supreme court decides the meaning or application of a state law or constitutional provision, and there are no federal law aspects to the decision, then the Supreme Court will not grant review.  The second of these considerations is whether review of the decision below is necessary.  The principal reason the Supreme Court grants review on certiorari is to fulfill its role in synthesizing the applications of federal law across the Nation.  Supreme Court practitioners refer to the question of conflicts in the Circuit Courts, or in the State Courts of last resort.  In the Hill petitions, we suggested that the Court exercise its power of discretionary review by granting our petition because the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals, in the first instance, and of the Colorado Supreme Court, in the second instance, stood in stark conflict with decisions of other State Supreme Courts and certain federal appellate courts.  Another reason often cited, but not nearly so often granted on, is that the decision below conflicts with decisions of the US Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court does not take the view that its job is to correct erroneous factual findings or clear legal errors below, if that is the sole reason for granting review.  That being said, some petitions seem to be granted, an infinitesimally small number, on such grounds.  There are many practitioners on Avvo and elsewhere that could assist you with this matter.  The costs, however, can be exorbitant.   Just printing the petition and reply alone can run to Three to Five Thousand Dollars, not mentioning legal fees.  I have seen fee awards, following victory at the Supreme Court, in cases where fee shifting statutes allow for an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, that range upward of 250,000.00.  Finally, all the considerations are not meant to suggest that you should simply forget about it.  Seek legal counsel if you can.  If not, use the Court's website to access the rules of practice for the Court.  There are thousands of nonpaid petitions filed at the Court each year.  Few are ever granted, but some are, and important principles of law have resulted from such cases."

I would hope she would not actually attempt that; if she did you could both be in more trouble than either wants, with the police and with family services.  At 16, you are not fully mature emotionally and intellectually. But neither are you fully mature at 18, nor 21, magical ages at which you're suddenly vested with permissions to do all sorts of things which may harm your development. You are mature enough right now, however, to make many decisions on your own, and I believe parents ought to support you in those kinds of decision. I suspect how you wear your hair is one of those. It isn't a decision that threatens your health or well-being, and you should be allowed to find for yourself what does and doesn't suit you.   You are at your age, and should be, differentiating yourself from your parents. Your parents' ideas are not yours, and while it may be painful for a parent to discover their child has independent thoughts and tastes and ways of living in the world, it is a pain worth bearing, because allowing you to find for yourself who you are, what you like, is a wonderful uncovering. I have seen it in my own children, and your mother should not miss seeing it in hers.  You are not in total control of your life, but neither is your mother. The fact that we feed and clothe and shelter our children is our privilege and responsibility, and not a weapon to be withheld if they don't do as we say.  A lot of people have worn dreadlocks with no apparent long-term harm. Is there anyone who doubts Bob Marley's gifts to our species? Whoopie Goldberg's? Lauren Hill's, Erykah Badu's, Johnny Depp's? (Well, maybe Johnny Depp's.)  There are dreadlock traditions throughout history and cultures. Spartans wore dreads. So did Aztec priests. Hindus, Buddhists, Christians have worn dreads. Ain't nobody gonna hold a Maasai warrior down and cut off his hair. Doctors, lawyers, and probably Indian chiefs have worn dreadlocks.   There are worse looks. Albert Einstein looked like he stuck his finger in an electrical socket. Abraham Lincoln apparently cut his hair with a hatchet. Henry David Thoreau must have sprayed chocolate cool whip on his head. What was Ben Franklin thinking, anyway?  It's not about what's on your head; it's what's in your head.  If it's true for you, tell your mother that what's in your head is love for her, and love for you, too, and that your wanting to dreadlock your hair is an expression of that love for yourself, for the self you want to try on for a little while, and see if it fits. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. But you want to try, and you want her to help you try, and you hope she can do that.  I hope so, too. Not just for you: in two years you can do what you want, that's true. But I hope your mother doesn't find herself in two years, if you've left the shelter of your home, wishing she had let you do some of the things you wanted to try at no harm to either."

You should check with a bankruptcy attorney to see about those steps."
1794095,"Mr. Berson gives you good advice.  While you, as the surviving spouse, are entitled to all or most (depending upon which other family members there are) of your late husband's estate, it is not ""automatic.,"" except as to assets that were jointly held or assets as to which there is a designated beneficiary.  It sounds as though you need to do an administration proceeding.  If the value of the boat and trailer are low enough, you might be able to do a small estate proceeding, which is quicker, easier, and cheaper.  But, in any event, it should not be a complicated proceeding if those are the only assets that he had at the time that he passed away.  Good luck to you."

1791367,"This is a fine line.  If the attorney was representing the trustee regarding trust business, yes the attorney can charge the trust.  If the attorney was representing the trustee based on his/her breaches, and it was found he/she breached the trust, there is a good argument that the trustee is responsible for the attorney fees.  If you settled, look to the settlement agreement - it should say who is responsible for what attorney fees."
1793933,An innocent person can plead guilty to a crime they did not commit.  If they voluntarily and knowingly tell the judge what they did to be guilty and if the judge determines it is a crime and accepts the guilty plea they then face disposition.  To try and undue a guilty plea later is very difficult if the judge accepted the guilty plea.  The lesson here is don't plead guilty with the expectation of later changing your mind. It would be very important to discuss a guilty plea with a lawyer before you do it.
1814549,Use the attorney who won the 1538.5 on the first case unless you can't afford them. There are other attorneys that charge less. Shop around here on avvo using the find a lawyer app. Last possibility is a PD if they handled the underlying case.                                                                  On the second DUI question you should lawyer up. Cases like this could end up as a first DUI again if there is a no resolution of the appeal when it comes time to plead or otherwise act on this second offense. That will surely happen before the appeal.                                                                           For DMV make sure you set the hearing within 10 days. DMV will count it as a second so lawyer up. PD's cannot do DMV hearings.                                                                                                                              Probable cause for the stop on the second can be an issue but admittedly you slowed down. Too slow can be the reason for the stop! A lawyer will need to review the police report to determine probable cause for the stop. Good luck. Hope this helps?
2315086,"Well...  Good question. It is likely not part of the lawsuit as it is not executive action like deferred action it's more like when they amended the regs for h-4 ead that took forever.

As a matter of full disclosure, I am a Republican."
1816176,"What I think you are saying is that you've licensed a product to someone else (a licensee) who wants to manufacture and sell it, and now they've discovered that they can't make the thing because of a threat of patent infringement, or that the thing can't be manufactured or is inoperable. So you want to know if your licensee has a claim against you.  That depends on the language in the license. If the license contained a representation that there was no patent infringement, or a warranty that the product was manufacturable and operable, then you might have a problem. A well crafted license would normally put the burden of due diligence on the licensee.    If you are in NY or NJ you can call me for a consultation."

1812903,"Attorney Berkus articules the math to determine. And if you further deduct the sales costs if property is sold your asset is worth even less. How long you have lived in CA makes a difference and whether or not you live in the home. SOme persons I speak to would lose a value equity in a house unless they move into it before we file also. Below I set forth the issues for you..But no one can say which chapter here on AVVO as it takes knowledge of all the facts of income, assets, liabilities, and MORE! But no one files a ch 13 for fun..as you are in there 3 to 5 years..and only 95 days in a ch 7..so always see why NOT do a chapter 7 first!   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof! That includes your portion of that house!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

1801898,"If you are looking for the law, try RCW 72.09.270 which deals with reentry plans.  That law states, in part, ""in determining the county of discharge for an offender released to community custody, the department may not approve a residence location that is not in the offender's county of origin unless it is determined by the department that the offender's return to his or her county of origin would be inappropriate considering any court-ordered condition of the offender's sentence, victim safety concerns, negative influences on the offender in the community, or the location of family or other sponsoring persons or organizations that will support the offender.""    There's certainly far more to the law than that passage, but if you look at RCW 72 in conjunction with DOC 350.200 it may help answer some of your general questions about how DOC works and the legal foundation for how they operate."
1794914,"Mediation is NOT binding on anyone. If either you or your ex don't like it, it is thrown away and you start again in court - with the risk that the mediator's opinion is taken into account by the judge. Don't risk a large percentage of your future earnings without a lawyer.  Neither of you has an ""imputed"" income. You have an ""actual"" income that they will use. Your lawyer will argue this for you as well. (perhaps she is arguing that you have some ""under the table"" income that you have to defend). Since mean salary is 146, half make less. If she is younger than the average age, again a lower average. Your lawyer will argue that if her salary is lower because she doesn't work 40 hours, for example if she is working 25 hours, then 146 should be imputed. Let the lawyer work - there are too many things you will have to deal with that the OTHER lawyer will come up with as well. Like getting a medical opinion from a doctor or the guy who runs the newsstand and thinking the guy who runs the newsstand will be right more often, don't defend a lawyer without one. Since you just started working full time, that is the salary that should be used, and as you gain experience and make more then she can take you back for a change. USE A LAWYER TO ARGUE THIS - you will likely find it hard to  be calm about it.  For example, the argument culd be that you need 45,000 to live on and she needs 45,000 to live on, so your contribution should come out of her paying 90 percent for everything. Not a likely result but the kind of thing that you can move the argument toward.  If the ex has the right to decide schools, and Stevens is the school that she decided is better, and the judge agrees, it is Stevens. The argument is how much you can afford to pay, not whether somehow the difference in cost between Rutgers and Stevens magically disappears. This is another argument and fight for a seasoned lawyer who examines all the finances."

But you need counsel, and there is no question you will fare better with counsel."
1823585,I would need more facts but you do need to contact the Trustee and find out what is holding up the filing of taxes.

I'm the senior attorney in the Louisiana Legislative Bureau (note its presence on the flowchart), which is an arm of the Louisiana Senate, and read every bill that comes out of the 33 standing committees. Each bill must contain the introductory phrase: ""Be it enacted,"" or in the case of a resolution, ""Be it resolved."" The bill must also have a ""one-liner,"" a short summary of what the bill intends to do, and a ""title,"" which is not what one thinks of as a title in the ordinary sense, but instead a more detailed explanation of what the bills intends to do.

The previous attorneys are correct about the range of punishment so I won't go into that.    The big difference between 46.2-300 (Driving without a license) and 46.2-301 (Driving on Suspended) is  that First in 46.2-300 --> you must be driving and in 46.2-301 --> you can be driving or operating (keys in ignition)  Second difference is for 46.2-301, the Government must prove that you knew you were suspended where in 46.2-300 they just need to prove that your license was not valid.  So you can be convicted of 46.2-300 if you never had a license or if you were suspended and didn't know it was suspended."
2380157,"Appreciate the question.  If by ERC you mean Resolution Management Conference then for the most part, yes.  The court either on its own volition or by request of one of the parties will set a Resolution Conference.  Again, the majority of conferences, by court order, require each party or together to submit a resolution statement to the court.  The resolution statement informs the court of those issues which the parties agree and disagree.  It is an instrumental submission that helps posture the position of the individual parties or the entire litigation.  Many attorneys offer free consults and document review on issues such as the RMC and resolution statement.  The no cost discussion can take place in the East Valley, such as Gilbert."

If they do file a lawsuit, it will be a civil lawsuit, not a criminal proceeding.  They will pay a court filing fee, usually between $225 and $435.  Then, you do not need to sign anything in order to be served.  All that a real process server does is say, ""Mr. Smith, I have legal papers for you."" and hands you a copy of the court Summons and other papers.  Then the process server leaves.  If you are not home, you are not home and you are not served (unless someone else who lives at your home accepts the papers.)  Who are ""appropriate authorities"" -- in this case, no one.  I really doubt that a lawsuit was filed.  If they wanted to invest in a lawyer, court filing fee and a real process server, you would not have received this phone call.

Most pets unless pedigree and fairly young have no significant value and normally, if listed at all (usually adopted out quickly after the death), are shown at a nominal ($10 - $25 at best) value. When working on an estate, it is essential that you have a working relationship with your attorney.  You select the attorney who will represent you, not the other way around.  If after trying to work with this attorney, you find at the outset of representation that you can't work with him, then don't hire him.  If you are just at the stage of determining what assets are in the estate, it sounds like the estate has not been opened yet.  If this is the case, you may owe him a small fee for his initial review.  If the estate work has gone on further, you may owe more, but if your relationship isn't working out, it is time to hire someone else and end your relationship with him.  People may find themselves in an abusive relationship in a marriage (and even that has remedies), but this has no place in an attorney/client relationship.  You are the boss.  Remember that."

Many clients will ""describe"" their version of the circumstances and, not knowing all the steps, arrive at a wrong conclusion.  Now presuming the case was dismissed, the case law has been unforgiving in this context to the extent that, generally, a lender can simply re-initiate the process by sending  a new acceleration letter.  This letter would highlight a ""default"" on the basis of a later installment payment that was missed.  And thereafter, they can refile a foreclosure action and start the whole process again.

It could be just as simple as you appear nervous, which is sometimes a factor police use in determining if they should investigate further.  I wouldn't go to the police station and ask if they are investigating you.  If they are, they won't likely say ""yes, you got us, we're on to you for X, Y or Z.""

I can almost guarantee that will get you a call back.  However, if you are not the trustee, you had no power to sign a listing contract or a sales agreement for a property owned by the trust.  You need someone to explain to you how things work, and to evaluate the performance of the existing trustee.

1824745,"Dear Huntington Home Owner:  You may be certain that your tenant's lawyer believes you are the crazy side of the relationship. You really do need an attorney since you did not know a verbal notice has no legal value in New York. A NY landlord has the free right to end a verbal month to month tenancy with a one month notice. You missed the ""window"" to end the tenancy on August 31 and any notice made now, cannot act to end the tenancy earlier than September 30, 2014 (if the rent due date is the first day of the month.)  Your tenant's acts are destructive and dangerous; and you have a claim against the locksmith as well.  Allow your attorney to advise you whether you need to provide cable service when the tenant has negated the verbal rental agreement?  And, when you ask for rent, there is no need to do that face to face. New York law allows for a landlord a right to serve a written rent demand (without the rent demand and proof of service you will not be able to sue for unpaid rent.) Your lawyer is also likely to advise not to demand rent, as that only creates again a monthly tenancy, since a tenancy must exist to sue for rent. A landlord of a month to month tenant who misses one month rent, will likely never see rent again, and may as well leap direct to tenancy termination. See a lawyer."

886925,"Retaining private counsel is a very difficult question.  Most court-appointed attorneys are really very good (disclosure - I do court-appointed work as well, so I'm obviously biased on that point), but you're really only entitled to court-appointed counsel if you can't afford to hire someone.  So, from that consideration, if you can hire a private attorney you probably ought to.  It seems likely to be indicted and appears to have some complicated issues which will probably require extensive pre-trial litigation and favorable disposition short of trial could be difficult for any attorney.  Thus, when you're considering whether you should hire someone, you should assume that private representation for this case will probably be quite expensive.  It's obviously a very personal decision as to whether you (or your family) can afford that and if being able to choose your own attorney instead of having to accept whoever was appointed is worth it to you.  Also, it is very doubtful you would find an attorney to represent both of you because that is strongly discouraged by our rules of professional conduct."

2795099,"You absolutely can fight this! You did not surrender the premises simply because the electricity was off at 6PM. You had not delivered the keys. You were returning home to continue cleaning. You did not know the electricity would be off. Absent an agreement to the contrary, 10/31 ends at 11:59:59PM. If you want to clean in the dark, that is your right. The fact that you were at work and planned to clean upon returning home is further support of the argument that you did not surrender the property.   If the landlord intends to keep the security deposit, he must send you a notice, in writing, within 30 days of your moving out. If you have not received that notice by 11/30, the landlord loses his right to keep the security deposit. That does not mean that he cannot sue you for any damages, but he will have to be the one to go to the expense of doing that. Likewise, just because the landlord sends a notice, that does not mean he gets to keep all that money. If you DO receive the notice by 11/30, then you have 15 days to make an official objection (do not cash the check if one is included with the notice). I STRONGLY recommend you contact an experienced landlord-tenant lawyer to discuss the case at that point.                        DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!  It is important to note that even if you do not object within 15 days, you can still sue the landlord for keeping too much money. I know you do not want to spend tons of money on a lawyer just to get back a few hundred or thousand dollars. Find an attorney that offers a contingency fee for tenants. We routinely offer such fees to tenants because we understand the financial strain of enforcing your rights as a tenant. If you do not win, you do not pay attorneys' fees. If you are successful in getting just $1 more than what the landlord wants to give you, you are considered the winner and the landlord will have to pay your attorneys' fees AND taxable costs. That means that you never have to pay your attorneys' fee. The risk is that if you lose, you would have to pay the landlord's attorneys' fees and costs in addition to your own costs.  It is important, therefore, to have an experienced landlord attorney evaluate your case before proceeding."

The schedules are located at: http://dlis.dos.state.fl.us/recordsmgmt/gen_records_schedules.cfm .    An efficient way to have the records preserved is to gain access to the records and preserve them yourself.  This can be accomplished through a public records request, which if properly written will require the responding agency to cite any exemption to your request.  If an exemption is claimed by the responding agency, you then may request further information such as the agency's retention schedule, which may be identical to the DLIS, or may provide more storage time.  A follow-up request may then be made once the exemption expires or a Court Order may be applied for.

Imagine that the ""team"" was at another real estate company and the listing was yours, you would be the listing agent and they the selling agent. What is the custom as to the split in such a case? At a base, it would seem that you are entitled to at least that. It appears  that there was a foul-up at the management level of your company. That the assistant has left should make no difference. If it was company policy to report matters of this kind to the assistant, then you followed policy. Since you don't mention the ""team"" being told of the 50/50 split, I wonder was it the assistant's job to finalize the arrangement? If it was and she did not and the manager decides to give you less than you would otherwise be entitled, then you likely have a claim against your company.

What may very well be appropriate is for your company to take the entire commission and interplead you and the :""team"", pay the commission into the court and let the court decide the split. That relieves you of filing the suit. Ay least, your company should be holding the commission in an interest bearing account.Undoubtedly, all of the sales people involved are considered independent contractors and not employees.   Finally, in your business, certainly you know lawyers in the community. You should consult with one about this.  As to arbitration, unless there is an agreement to arbitrate, you cannot force arbitration after the fact.  How much it costs depends on the forum in which you arbitrate. Often retired judges are willing to arbitrate disputes.  Of course, he or she will have to be paid. This case could be arbitrated in a half day.  All parties could agree to make the arbitration binding and adopt the rules of some outside forum like, for example, the American Arbitration Association. Good luck"

1968544,"Being you are seeking a Florida Identification Card and not a Florida Driver's License, you should be okay.  Further, almost all defendants charged with DUI are charged with a misdemeanor, and misdemeanor warrants do not cross state lines.  Felony warrants cross state lines.  Odds are you'll get your Florida ID Card and maybe be told about the outstanding DUI from a quarter-of-a-century ago in our neighbor state.  It largely depends on whether the government worker at the DMV cares enough to inform you (of info that person may believe you have forgotten) or is the typical, bored and resentful, ""going through the motions"" seemingly animatronic figure so prevalent in government positions that deal with the American public."
1826468,"You absolutely need a lawyer to represent you in this matter.  Thee are ways to negotiate around this issue such that you won't be paying him support, but instead it would set off against the arrears.  Whether the ""full set off"" against $40k against whatever your support payments may be needs to be calculated and taken into consideration.  If he plays hard ball, you file a contempt case and obtain a judgment against him for the arrears, and then see what happens if and when he files a petition to modify custody.  Most family law firms, including mine will give you a free telephone consultation so that you can discuss the specifics in a confidential forum, which this is not."
1491433,"Depending on that country's immigration laws, it will determine if you could qualify for a visa with a felony conviction. As my colleague pointed out, you may consult with a criminal defense attorney to help you with a pardon or expungement if eligible and available under PA law. Also, consult with an immigration attorney who specializes in global immigration services, he or she will review the laws of the country you want to immigrate, advise you on the visa requirements and your eligibility, and assist you with the entire process including working with overseas counsel to make your transition as convenient as possible. Depending on the country, you may be eligible for dual nationality when you marry your spouse."
1829501,"You are free to enroll the child in any lawful activity as long as the other parent is not paying for the activity and the other parent's scheduled time with the child is not impacted.  ""ex says i pay child support so i should have say on what money is spent on"". That is not true. Does the ex have a say in what foods the child eats while the child is at your house? Does the ex have a say in what color the paint is in the room where the child sleeps in your house? The basic child support that the ex pays covers food and housing (among other necessities) for the child. No court is going to allow the ex a say in what foods the child eats when the child is with you or the paint color in the child's room at your house.  However, if you are expecting the ex to pay for the class or the class will be held during the ex's parenting time, you will need the ex's consent to enroll the child in that class unless the court order provides that you get to make the decision by yourself.  ""i put child in a martial art that had no chance of anything happening"". I am not sure that there is any activity that has ""no chance of anything happening"", especially when the actor is jumping, kicking, punching, and doing other physical activities.  If all this class switching is happening within a few weeks or months of each other, the ex is likely thinking that you are trying to game the system somehow. Perhaps (he thinks) you are trying to jack up the child support the ex pays. Perhaps you are trying to interfere with the ex's parenting time.  ""better value for money"" is not always the best criterion upon which to decide things. Perhaps the child does not like the new class you want him to take. Perhaps the child will do better in his current class even if it costs a little bit more.  You should review all the court orders to see what the court orders both parents to do.  You can review the specific facts with your attorney to find out your legal options."
1804130,"They can dded their interest to you, but that violates the deed of trust you signed with the bank. The bank may not know or care, but if they do, they can accelerate the note and require that you immediately pay the balance.  That is the choice you made when you agreed to put the on the deed.  A lawyer may be able to help you negotiate with the bank."
1784933,"I agree with previous answer completely.  I have been handling Medicaid Fraud cases for the part 2.5 years since the first letters from Human Resource administration went out.   The letters come from 2 places: 250 Church Street and 151 West Broadway, 7th floor.   Those letters should be taken very seriously as investigation is of the fraudulent information which was submitted to HR administration over the years and investigators usually have serious proof.  They visit your home and take pictures, talk to your neighboors and ask for your employment information from your employer.  If you put down that you are separated from your husband or wife they will visit the alleged place of residence and place or work for the separated spouse and take pictures.  Most of the time the fraudulent activity can be proven and it's really dangerous if you appear at this interview by yourself.  Most of the time I will ask a client not to appear at all and will go in their place.  I attend about 5 such interviews each single week and have been very successful in being able to solve this cases without further criminal charges being brought against such clients.  If you received a letter from HR administration contact my office and at least receive consultation of what you can expect based on the facts of your case.  At this point I will be able I tell you what will happen at your interview. If you feel comfortable with what I am telling you, I will be able to represent you as well."
1829334,"How were you made aware of the dealer's BK filing?  When you signed ""purchase documents"" at the dealership, the dealer usually will assign the purchase contract to a financing company, CU, bank, etc.  Absent such an assignment, the contract remains an asset of the bankruptcy estate of the dealership.  This the case irrespective of what kind of bankruptcy was filed.  I doubt a 13 was filed, so it is either a 7 or an 11.  Since your purchase contract is an asset, the Chapter 7 trustee should be getting in touch with you.  If the case is an 11, the BK lawyer for the dealership should be getting in touch with you.  Keep the vehicle insured, but eventually, you will have to commence payments pursuant to the contract.  Under a Chapter 7, you may be able to negotiate a lump sum payment less than what you owe on the contract.   You probably can't get the vehicle registered, but contact DMV to extend your temporary paper registration, if you have one.  If you want, send me the name of the dealership and I can search PACER to get specific details on the case and give you a report."
1807669,The cleanest way to do this is for you to file an RFO (Request for Order-Form FL-300) with the court demanding the temporary sole possession and control over the family residence.  IN the alternative you can file for Domestic violence restraining order if his infrequent visits and verbal attacks caused you fear for your own safety.
1796701,The type of injury you describe is a workers compensation claim and likely not a lawsuit.  Repetitive stress injuries are generally covered under the the Georgia law if your injury was within the course and scope of your employment.  You generally can not bring a personal injury lawsuit against your employer if your claim is made under  workers compensation. You could contact a qualified workers compensation attorney.
1653552,It will depend on which injury was sustained and where.What your average weekly wage was and what the extent of the permanent injuries are. You absolutely must retain an experienced workers compensation attorney immediately.The case actually looks very familiar to a work injury case that we recently worked out for a Korean speaking client in Maryland.

1829481,"Yes, you have to file a supplemental petition to modify and show a substantial change in circumstances. This issue is very common, and most judges grant these due to the saving in money.  Unless the judge feels leaving the child where he is at is in the child's best interests.  Whether it is worth it is a cost-benefit analysis. If you will save money in the long run and your attorney feels you have a good chance, then its worth it."
1826860,"As Mr. Barnes stated, California judgments last for 10 years and must be renewed before they expire. If this was entered in 2003, then it seems over due by several months and your posting stated it was renewed for another 7 years, but that is also suspicious. The attorney you had back in 2003, do you know his or her name or do you have the same insurance company to help you deal with this? If you had insurance for that accident and this is part of that case, then the insurance should still cover it and your former attorney should be able to help you resolve it.  The judgment should have been satisfied back in 2003 when your attorney dealt with the matter. Act promptly, as your wages can be garnished and your bank account levied if this is a valid judgment.

1826276,"I would suggest that you ask your attorney to contact Judge Angela Ordonez's office, who is the Chief Justice of  the Probate and Family Court,  to notify her of the name of the Judge who gave your ex your impounded address in open court and, if I understand correctly, that the Judge did so while there was active restraining order against your ex.  I am suggesting that you request that your attorney contact the Chief Justice based on a ""speech"" that she gave this year, at the Annual Family Law Conference, in which she stated, that her office should be notified about problems with the courts and judges.  She explicitly emphasized that there would be no retaliation against any attorney for contacting her to lodge a complaint.  If your attorney declines to do so, I would strongly suggest that you seek new counsel, and look for any attorney with expertise in child custody issues and restraining orders; who will zealously advocate on your behalf and in the best interests of your child; and who has experience practicing before your Judge.  I cannot emphasis that you need to hire a new attorney that has a great deal of experience practicing before your Judge! Your situation sounds heartbreaking and no one should have to go through what you are going through in our court system and be in fear of their life so much so that they would give up visiting  with their child. Best of Luck, Karen D. Lane, Esq. P.S.  Have you been working with the Domestic Violence Representative at either the District or Probate and Family Court?"
1814772,"S corp is generally a great option where there is little possibility of ever taking on investment capital.

1800728,"Often times parties are not agreeable to the findings of the Qualified Medical Examiner (""QME""). You must make sure your attorney properly files an objection. Once you've objected to the report you have made it clear to the opposing party that you take issue with the findings of the QME. You can then use further discovery tools to make your case. You can set a cross x of the medical professional where you can examine the medical professional under oath and inquire about their findings. You may also agree with opposing counsel to be evaluated by an ""AME"" Agreed Medical Examiner."

The DA does NOT have that 30 day time period if the person were given probation, instead of a deferred judgment and sentence. It is only for a DJ & S. You can't file a Motion to Compel. That is for civil cases. No, you can not terminate a D J & S early without the DA's consent, because it is a contract with the DA and not modifiable."
899598,"Your attorney can always send the g-28 now, if she forgot to include it with the 601 package. I think if it was received Aug 6th it is too early to be worrying, but you attorney should make sure they have his or her g-28. Good luck."
1805748,Completing CRO and a rehab program should help your case especially if they will give you good recommendations to the prosecutor. Some areas in Alabama have drug court referral. If you complete drug court your case will be dismissed and you will not have a felony record. It seems that you have made good use of the time you have been waiting to go to trial. Your attorney should be able to use all of these good works in order to help you in your plea.
1792552,You would need documentation from your home country with the correct information. Chances are good it would take more than 9 months to do it.   Check out the Hardship License - section 521 Transportation Code. - it might be a better solution for you.
1812279,"This is one of the difficulties in dealing with oil companies concerning royalty payments.  The oil company often takes the position that they will not make any changes without a court order on the matter.  They don't want the liability of making a mistake interpreting the powers of a trust, assignments of interest, etc., so they make the mineral owner jump through hoops.  At the end of the day, they don't care how much it costs you to have these interests transferred as long as they are protected."
1809296,"You need more than just the doctor, who will testify what treatment was given and what your injuries were. You're going to need an expert to testify that the treatment was reasonably necessary, and another expert to testify as to the reasonable value of that treatment. Without all three of these experts, you are unlikely to recover.  Hire a lawyer who can protect your interests, who knows what experts need to be retained, and who will advance the costs of their fees. By attempting to represent yourself you are irreparably damaging your case. You need to immediately retain qualified counsel."
1795018,"That's a complicated question.  Many practiced lawyers are terrible brief writers, and not necessarily due to lack of experience or education.  Effective brief writing depends on an attorney's ability to analyze legal precedent and refine persuasive arguments applying said analysis to shed favorable light on the facts of the case.  It is unlikely that anyone, holding a law degree or otherwise, will be able to simply glean this skill from a book.  That being said, the Eleventh Circuit mails all new members a copy of Strunk & White's ""The Elements of Style"" upon admission, but this may be more for humorous effect than anything else.  Your best bet may be to search legal briefs and judicial opinions on the internet to get a feel for how this is done."
1487184,"I live and work in California and deal with accidents like yours all the time, so I am happy to answer your question. The answer to your question is your gut instinct is right in that you are not certain about your rights. First step to take is not to talk to the Walgreen's claim department because they will try to pin down your statement of what happened and where you are injured.  There goal is usually to hurt your case, not help it. You're going to need to hire a lawyer in order to get results. You are entitled to have your property damage, medical bills and future medical expenses PAID FOR BY THE OTHER PARTY'S INSURANCE. The attorney you hire will handle the claims process from start to finish.   But you are going to need to see a specliast to even get a shot at getting future medical treatment from the Defenedant. Moreover it sounds like the accident is completely the other persons fault so you don't want this case to become a difficult one because of lack of inattention. The insurance company will make you believe that your case is worth very little... Regarding pain and suffering, you need to speak to an experienced attorney that can strategize your case. Just because you were in an accident doesn't mean you have pain and suffering, at least thats what the insurance companies think. Make no doubt about it you have a great case, but you need help from a professional. You are entitled to your medical bills being covered as well.   Do you feel that you are at the same medical condition that you were before the accident? As a basic premise I wouldn't handle your claim by yourself. The attorney you hired can likely refer you to a doctor, if you ask for one, who will see you with no upfront payment! I've done this many times to help my clients out. You should not wait a single day to hire a lawyer, we will advise you on the strategy of your case. There is no upfront cost to hire an attorney.   With a case like yours it seems like you have some good facts in order to get a high settlement, but your case definitely needs to be developed further to corroborate your story. The most important thing when building your case are: liability (were you at fault); how bad are your injuries to your body. A lot of these things sound like they are not complete yet in your case so its something that is worth hiring an attorney for in order to get a sense of whether you have a case and what the strategy would be for you to build a strong case! I've handled cases and/or spoken to clients in the Daily City, CA area.   Its very possible that your case is worth more than the $$$ that the insurance company will offer you by yourself. Make your life easier and call an attorney today, you won't regret it."
1803102,"Your question properly should be addressed to the bankruptcy panel.  I have reposted your question there.  Nevertheless, any bankruptcy filing can have an effect on your financial affairs.  As a result, that affect could change your responses in the FAFSA form that you filled out.  You really need to review those responses with a bankruptcy attorney and/or accountant to determine the changes to the student aid application as a result of the changes to your financial situation."
1813206,I agree with Mr. Hance. You probably will need to talk to an attorney in FL to handle your matter and evaluate your options. Sorry for your loss.
1809848,"A naturalization applicant must be physically present in the US for at least one-half of the 5 years (or one-half of 3 years if the applicant is the spouse of a US citizen). Regarding the citation, you would need to disclose it (good moral character question) but it should not be a problem based on your facts. You should consider hiring or at least consulting with an immigration attorney who could go over all the eligibility requirements and help you in your naturalization case."
1793262,You need to seriously read Family Code 3047 concerning military deployment and the ability of your extended family to be able to exercise your visitation during deployment.  This is designed to maintain your bond with your child during deployment by letting them have a relationship with your family in your absence.  It would also maintain your timeshare.   If child support is being recalculated then you also need to read Family Code 3651 that allows you to continue the hearing if you are deployed. Good Luck and return home safely.

1802192,"You proved that you formed your business but not that it is still operating legally in NJ. You can do this with a ""short form standing certificate"" which attests that you are current in all your requirements like annual filings with the state so your business is legally continuing to operate.  http://www.nj.gov/treasury/revenue/standcert.shtml shows where to file the forms and that it costs fifty dollars to get from the state."
1803162,"If you have already addressed your concerns with your ex and they have fallen on deaf years, it maybe time to file a motion with the Court. The success of your application to the Court will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the reason you do not want the child's Aunt to babysit,  and the amount you are paying. You should consult with a family law attorney as soon as possible to further discuss this matter."
1829656,Your letter (written without a lawyer) won't impress GoDaddy. You should expect litigation unless you release the name to the trademark owner.
1822567,There is a waiver for making a material misrepresentation. The requirements for the waiver will depend upon whether you are seeking a nonimmigrant or immigrant visa. You should schedule a consultation with an experienced immigration attorney to discuss the matter further.
1821292,"First, I'm pretty sure ""theft of services"" is strictly a criminal matter -- your civil complaint would allege something like breach of contract or conversion instead. While there isn't enough information to say whether you have a cause of action in federal court, contracts fall almost exclusively under state court jurisdiction. As my colleagues point out, federal court has very specific jurisdictional requirements.  A better question to ask would be: why would you WANT to sue in federal court? State courts are usually far more Plaintiff-friendly..."
1791247,"This is not unusual.  The lender intentionally underestimates the amount of the amount that needs to be paid for the tax escrow, and then a few months after you start paying, they correct the amount, and demand a lump sum payment. They then put the payments they receive from you ""in suspense"" until they stop accepting payments from you altogether."
1811714,"Ms. James and Mr. McGinnis are correct.  There is nothing inherent in a generic life estate that would keep you from purchasing your father's life estate interest, or renting the home from him during his lifetime, but a life estate can be granted with a broad variety of governing provisions.  Your best move is to sit down with an attorney with experience in real estate and estate planning and review the life estate documents.  Your attorney can help you determine if and how your father's rights can be transferred, and if there is a way to proceed regarding the interests of any other remaindermen."
1807237,"You admit you rolled through a stop sign, but you want the judge to rule in your favor and dismiss the ticket because the cop made a mistake. Fat chance of that. So, take pictures and be able to tell the judge exactly what happened, but wait until after the cop makes his big mistake and says you rolled to the left, then pounce on what the cop said as being impossible. Is that your plan?  If you admit you rolled through the stop sign, just pay the ticket or go speak with a ticket lawyer about it."
1791690,The jail will assist you with authorized vendors.  Best wishes.
1798288,"You have two issues - how to stop the harassment, and what to do about the judgment debt. The other attorneys are correct in that you need a consultation with an attorney to assess the big picture.  In order to stop phone calls from an attorney collecting this judgment, you can mail the attorney a letter telling him or her not to call you. Mail it certified mail, return receipt requested, and keep the green card proof. You cannot stop a collector from mailing you letters asking for payment of the judgment, but it would be a good idea to have your own lawyer look over those letters to make sure there are no Federal or State law violations in the letters.  Be sure and promptly respond to any ""Notice of Right to Claim Exempt Property"" which you may receive by mail or from the Sheriff. There is only a 20 day window to file your response. Seek legal help immediately if you receive one of these. If you ignore this, the creditor may be able to take your property including your car, or freeze your bank account, because your judgment exemptions (protections) are waived.  Options for dealing with this long term include settlement, payment in full over time, and bankruptcy. Which option is best for you depends upon your specific circumstances and cannot be answered here. Please consult with a qualified attorney. Most attorneys who handle these kind of matters will give a consultation for a very affordable fee. Even if you decide to leave things the way they are for now, your mid will be eased by knowing about the specific options available to you."
1815244,"I would need to know more about what Court orders are in place. Since Arizona does have a statute which allows you your own rights, Father should not be able to interfere with those if they were ordered.    If you do not have orders established,  I would want to know more about that.   A qualified and experienced family law attorney can of course assist you in considering your options and then getting where you need to be. Most of us offer free, å_ hour consultations, in which your matter can be discussed in detail. That would be a great opportunity to discuss the specifics of your matter and develop a plan."
1826757,"Under the UCCJEA, the state that makes an initial custody determination has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction so long as a parent still resides in that state. You should hire experienced, local counsel to file a special appearance objecting to jurisdiction in Virginia under the UCCJEA. The other party may be required to pay attorney's fees and costs."
1809840,"As I'm reading this, you had an attorney in your original case and, when you sought assistance from them at this time for a modification proceeding, they requested another $2500 retainer.  That is not actually a reasonable amount and, if you can manage it, you know yourself that things will go smoother with an attorney's assistance.  As to whether or not you ""have to"" send out those interrogatories etc., no you don't ""have to"" but why wouldn't you?  There is mandatory disclosure which both parties have to do and then there are these interrogatories and additional requests for documents.  If they are asking you to complete them, go ahead and make him do the same. But, you don't ""have to."""
1794690,"It's likely they could, but they would need to be unusually smart and aggressive. Typically the statute will give sixty or ninety days for a creditor to make a claim after being notified that some form of estate administration has begun. Or, if the family doesn't administer the estate then liability will be cut off after say two or three years.   In the meantime, it's possible the family could just go on renewing the tag and insurance. That may not be the *right* thing to do, but I'm saying it likely could be done.   They really should consult with an Oklahoma estate practitioner in order to determine whether there is a form of administration (or distribution without administration) that can be done affordably so that the car has the best chance of not going to the creditors."
1806746,"Wow! Sorry to hear of your circumstances. I recommend that you file a supplemental petition for modification of of prior court order. It is not a motion. Rather it is a supplemental petition. Your ex needs to be served with the supplemental petition and a summons.  Your supplemental petition for modification should ask for supervised time sharing, reduced time with the child, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for your child and a psychological evaluation of your ex."
1799592,"If you have a security interest in a Note that is secured by a deed of trust that is referred to as ""Chattel Paper"". (meaning of the person who is indebted to you gave you as security, his or her interest as the creditor on another secured Note that a 3rd party is paying).  Look at Article 9 for perfection of Chattel paper. Basically it's like anything else, you describe it in the UCC-1 and record it at the Secretary of States Office. However you must have possession of the original Note. There is no other way to have a security interest in a mortgage. Sounds like you need an attorney consultation to even determine what you have based on this and your prior similar question and determine what the issues are you are trying to resolve."
1799710,Yes.  The employer who sponsors you will include the request to change status in the E3 petition.
1812227,"I agree with the other answers, but it doesn't seem like anyone has answered your specific question, which was whether you are liable for bad advice from your attorney.  The answer to that is an unequivocal YES.     You are hiring the attorney as your representative, so it is very important to fully research your bankruptcy attorney before you hire them.     See my article below for more information on this."
1819620,"The Petitioner, after 30 days of service on the Respondent, should file a Request For Default and then proceed to get the matter to resolution.  If the Petitioner files a Request for Default, then they should file a request for a Default Trial after 6 months to get the court to declare the marriage is dissolved and to divide all the CP assets and debts.  But, it is their responsibility to get the divorce done.  The court does not do this for them.  Too many people think that my just filing the divorce petition they will automatically be divorced in 6 months.  That isn't how it happens."
1820726,"This appears to be less a legal issue, than a personal family issue. If you find your wife and mother-in-law are not listening to you and respecting your wishes, you are free to contact the vendors and change your usernames/passwords."
1791930,Your son should receive counseling if he has not already gotten it.  You should consult with an attorney immediately concerning whether a civil action is possible.  The police will inform you if they feel a criminal case can be brought against the perp.  Best wishes to you and you son.
1813995,"Can it?  Yes.    Will it?  Probably not.  Unless you have a CDL, paying for a 1-10 over ticket does not go on your driving record.  Probation staff usually check driving records and arrest records. ONE CAUTION: I am assuming you are past the revocation period of your license.  But if not (if you are still under revocation or using a modified license, a conviction for the ticket may affect your driving privileges.  So, if this is your situation, contact an attorney before paying the ticket.  If you are fully reinstated, then it's not an issue)"
1807826,"Mr. Dane and Mr. Marek are correct. (1) There is no true expungement statute in California. What's often called ""expungement"" is actually dismissal after the fact. (2) You cannot dismiss felonies unless they are wobblers.  If they are, you first need to get them reduced to misdemeanors under penal code section 17(b).  You can then get them dismissed under penal code section 1203.4.  You will need an attorney's help to do any of these things.  Consult one ASAP."
1805494,"Merhaba Zeki, That was not the right question, Zeki. As the spouse of a US citizen you are deemed to be an ""immediate relative"" (""IR"").  IRs do not need to maintain valid non-immigrant status (for you that means you don't need to apply for the GC before your F-1 status expires), nor do IRs ever get penalized for having engaged in unlawful employment.   But just watch out, and as my esteemed colleague suggested there are many things that could go wrong with that green card application if not properly prepared and filed with professional help by an experienced immigration attorney.  Any error and/or omission has the potential of setting you aback by months and even getting your case denied.  Kolay gelsin!"
1822915,"If the plaintiff dismisses the lawsuit without prejudice while your demurrer is pending and without your agreement for a waiver of costs, then this will probably be considered by the court to be a favorable termination on the merits for you. This means, you could probably successfully apply as the ""prevailing party"" for an award of costs against the plaintiff, which would be your filing fee(s), process service fee(s), and any motion costs or fees. So, we are talking about five or six hundred bucks.  As a practical matter, the plaintiff should not need to dismiss and re-file because most judges liberally grant plaintiffs leave to amend their defective complaints. It is not until there have been two or three attempts to get it right that the court is likely to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.  I hope this answers your question."

2303149,"I have to make some guesses. I'm guessing you and your mom entered without inspection, that is, you didn't enter with a visa or border crossing card. You came across the border in secret and avoided capture. I'm guessing you were over age 21 when your mom adjusted status, so you were too old to adjust with her. I'm guessing you are not married to a US citizen, and I'm guessing your mom is not yet a US citizen. Because you entered without inspection, you are not eligible to stay in the US and apply for a green card. Even if your mom has petitioned for you, the only way you can get legal is to go back to your home country and apply for an immigrant visa there. Once you leave the US however, you will be barred from reentry for ten years because you have been in the US for over one year without authorization. You may soon be able to apply for a provisional waiver of the ten year bar, if you can show it would be an extreme hardship to your green card holding mother, if you had to go back to your home country for ten years. Note: depending on when your mom filed a petition for you, and what country you are from, you may still have to wait a very long time before an immigrant visa quota number is available to you. If any of my guesses are wrong, then the answer may change. Make an appointment with an immigration lawyer. See the link to AILA below for help in finding an immigration lawyer near you."
1817390,"Corporate squeeze-outs are particularly vicious types of litigation matters. Because they involve issuance of securities, the applicable fraud provisions my extend to ""failure to state"", not merely ""material misrepresentation"". Your being induced to move to California raises a little-known statute potentially providing for triple damages on any employment law claim.  You need an in depth analysis with an attorney, way beyond Avvo. You need to assemble a narrative of your entire history with this company, annotated with labeled documents that back up your factual recitation. The more organized you are, the better an impression you will make on the attorney(s) that you interview.   If your only problem is ""vesting"" that may be a function of the permit to issue securities, but I suspect it is a delaying tactic and part of a ""squeeze-out"" I alluded to above."

So if you forgot the procedure and there is no evidence that you did it on purpose, you cannot be denied benefits.  If the DOL has made an initial decision against you, then you must file for an appeal within 15 days.  At the hearing, the employer has the burden of proof and the above standard applies.

1790836,"This was a terrible idea and I assume you were not represented by counsel.  You NEVER underestimate a workers comp claim because if you do, your trustee can and may object, or if its later determined it has value, your trustee will go after every penny of it that was not declared. So if you valued the exemption at zero, and you get 1 dollar, the trustee may go after it anyway. Not that the trustee would succeed, but if you're unrepresented a trustee could succeed if you don't know how to respond.  You should have placed ""undetermined"" or ""unliquidated"" in the area instead of listing it with zero value. And you should have claimed it in Schedule C as exempt under the workers comp statute.  Fla. Stat. 440 .22 says:   ""benefits shall be exempt from all claims of creditors, and from levy, execution and attachments or other remedy for recovery or collection of a debt, which exemption may not be waived. "" and the exception is alimony and child support debts which can be levied against those claims.  There is no exemption for personal injury under Florida law. You have standard exemptions pursuant to Fla. Stat. 222.

You need to see if there is any provision in the lease for the landlord having the ability to charge for an overnight guest before you attempt to file in small claims court.  If you are not sure about this, you may want to have an attorney review the lease to determine the best course of action."
1814628,"Social Security does make errors from time to time. If you believe that you were denied benefits, but they are indicating that you still have a claim pending, it would be important to understand more of what happened. There are times that Social Security pulls denials for quality review. In those situations, a decision is not supposed to be issued, but sometimes is sent out by mistake. If the case is pulled for quality review the decision is not supposed to be sent out until after the quality review is completed.  The other situation that I can think of is after an Administrative Law Judge Hearing. The Appeals Council selects a portion of all claims (including approvals), to review on their own motion. Even if you did not appeal, your claim can be reopened in this situation.  If you were approved benefits, and Social Security indicates that the claim is still open, it could always be because you were approved for one disability program, but your eligibility under another program is still pending (for example you are approved for SSI because they can easily determine that you are disabled as of now, but your Social Security Disability Insurance claim is still pending to determine if you were disabled before your date last insured).  I would suggest that you contact the Social Security Administration to learn more information. If a representative cannot answer your question, consider meeting with an attorney with all letters you have receive from Social Security to determine if they can help. Your US Representative or Senator may also be a good resource.  Please feel free to clarify your answer, and hopefully someone can provide you with more information."

That is sensible given your description of your marriage. As with all important issues, there are many tradeoffs and a decision may be nuanced and not clearcut.  I think it fair to observe that my profession once believed, mediation was never appropriate for parties with big issues of power and control. Some modern researchers note, however, in some of these cases, the benefits of securing a partner's voluntary compliance and more immediate disengagement can outweigh the loss of certain legally protected economic or other gains. I recommend you speak, perhaps in person, with several professionals before making a final decision. Good luck to you!"

This is a very important procedural requirement and since you are held to the same standard as an attorney, if you serve your opponent with a 237 notice without prior discovery requests, your opponent will be within his rights to object."
1797487,"I agree with Attorneys Shields and Elder.  The county welfare department cannot unilaterally determine your mother's mental capacity and they cannot grant anyone the power to handle her finances. If someone does not have capacity to make financial decisions for themselves and there are no estate planning documents in place that address this issue, the proper procedure  is for a Probate petition for Conservatorship to be filed. Even if a Conservatorship petition is filed, the proposed Conservatee (your mother, for example) has the right to her own attorney and to object to the Conservatorship. Additionally, a determination of capacity is made by a doctor, not the county welfare department.   Ordinarily, if a bank suspects financial or other elder abuse, they would make a report to Adult Protective Services asking them to investigate. If their investigation warrants, the case may be referred to the Public Guardian for a determination as to whether a Conservatorship (for example) is needed.   I agree with Attorney Elder that your mother should contact an elder law attorney as soon as possible."

These steps include filing an immigrant visa petition (DS-260) online and an Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) filled out by your spouse.

1816687,"Motions are simply a legal way of asking the court to do something:  for example, dismiss your case, suppress or exclude certain evidence, prevent the prosecutor from arguing or mentioning something to the jury, or allow your side to present certain evidence at trial.  They must be filed in good faith (with factual and legal grounds to seek the relief sought), and then scheduled for hearing at a later date, allowing the other side a chance to respond with legal authority and perhaps an evidentiary hearing.  You should ask your lawyer to explain what motions are being filed (request a copy), and what he or she hopes to gain by doing this.  Obviously, the goal most times (if you can't get the case dismissed outright) is to make the state's case weaker and present difficulties of proof, which could result in a better chance at trial, or a better offer for you."
1828567,"'Yes' the state may use witnesses whose stories don't match.  The jury/judge will have to decide if the misalignment in stories is material to the charges or not.

1806900,"Your question is far too broad to be given an accurate answer.  No reputable employment attorney could conclusively answer one way or the other just based on these sparse facts, nor should such a response really be expected.  Your employer must pay the promised agreed upon wage for a particular employee.  However, California is an at-will state which not only applies to termination and hire procedures but wages as well (so long as it does not fall minimum wage), as you correctly stated.  Threatening to lower someone's pay is not illegal.  However, it depends on why and under what circumstances.  For instance, if your employer is threatening to lower someone's wages or fire them for something considered protected conduct such as a ""whistle blower"" statute issue then you have a case.  However, if he is relating the pay to performance, that is not illegal.  A customer complaint depends on what type of complaint and why your employer is saying what he's saying.  None of these things can be learned from your general question.  You or your ""friend"" should speak with a qualified employment attorney.  Most of us offer free consultations to go through a deep dive of the facts.  You may find some on here or the calbar.org website or cela.org which is specifically for employment attorneys who represent employees on these type of actions.  Good luck to you."

1024432,"There is no set timeframe for holding a revocation hearing once a probationer has been incarcerated on a probation warrant.  Dekalb Superior Court is very busy and it might take a while for this to reach a revocation calendar.    More importantly, your husband is ultimately facing revocation of his First Offender status and prison time on a resentencing.  120 hours of community service can be done in a year at the rate of 2-3 hours a week, so he must have not done community service for a while in order for the probation department to be requiring him to do 8 hours in one day/week.  Therefore, his defense will be difficult and will depend largely upon convincing the judge to give him another chance.  This might be accomplished by his employment status (holding down two jobs) and family circumstances.  I would probably ask for his community service to be commuted into the time that he is serving right now.  Then the question becomes whether he gets to keep his First Offender status.  He really needs to retain counsel to help him try to keep his First Offender.  An attorney will know what evidence to present (and more importantly, what not to present) in order for him to have the best chance of retaining his First Offender status.  Call me if I can be of assistance."
1808211,"You should hire an attorney who will get involved at this early stage in setting up a good defense if later necessary.

1813040,"There's one other element of things that hasn't been mentioned that you should be aware of, and that's filling out applications for federal public aid to pay your tuition (FAFSA).  Under the federal laws that govern the program, the government calculates how much aid you are eligible for based on how much income your parents make.  The federal law assumes that your parents will provide you a certain amount of help and limit how much aid you can receive based on that assumption.  It seems a bit odd--limiting the amount of aid YOU can get even though it doesn't require anything of your parents, I know.  Usually, both parents need to cooperate and assist you in filling out your FAFSA application.  If you have no contact with your dad and aren't able to do this, there are ways of letting the program know this.  I've included a link to the handbook on Federal Aid so that you can familiarize yourself with it.

1795143,"Hello Oshkosh,  While you can file for a fiance visa for your fiance, the question is whether the previous deportation order will prevent him from using the visa, even if approved.  For example- if he was ordered to remain outside the US for 10 years, the fiance visa will not cancel that out.  He would need to apply for permission to be re-admitted to the US first to deal with the underlying order.  It is a good thing that he complied with it and has stayed out so long- those are all favorable actions.  If he or you still have the original immigration court paperwork, including the order/sentencing portions, consider bringing or sending those to an experienced immigration attorney for review on how best to move forward in the case.  I hope that helps clarify the issues."

Your girlfriend may sponsor you for a green card once you are married and she secures her citizenship - available to her 4 years and 9 months after issuance of her green card, subject to your criminal history.  This should be reviewed by an immigration attorney in detail to determine if any problems would prevent adjustment of status."
1824342,"In your case, if you have already filed a bankruptcy petition those taxes cannot be discharged because the return had to have been filed at least two years before you filed the bankruptcy petition.  The returns should be prepared and filed because that is the only way to start the clock running on the statute of limitations; however, filing them will not make them dischargeable if you've already filed a Ch. 7.  I would strongly urge you to consult, at least briefly, with a bankruptcy attorney before you proceed with your case."
1788474,"You really should consult an attorney.  Beyond the mold issue, the fact that the tenant moved out in 2011 and filed a lawsuit in 2014 gives me pause -- if the lawsuit wasn't filed within 3 years, then landlord may have a statute of limitations defense to get the case dismissed -- and motions to dismiss should be filed before an answer to a civil complaint.  Moreover, most mold related ailments tend to resolve after being removed from the house -- if there was no mold in your rental unit, I'm thinking there may have been other intervening causes for the tenants claimed illnesses.

1761725,"The Nashville Bar Association's legal help hotline will probably point you in the right direct for finding a plaintiff's attorney that practices legal malpractice. It is difficult to tell whether you have a good claim based on the facts you have given.  It can be very difficult to win a legal malpractice case, just like a medical malpractice claim, because you must show not only that the attorney made a mistake, but that this mistake was unreasonable when judged by a reasonable attorney standard. In addition, you must show you actually suffered damages because of the mistake. You will need to give a full recitation of the facts and all of the filings to an attorney for review of the merits of this case.  You can also reach out to the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility if you feel that an attorney has taken action in your case without your permission.  While it will not entitle you to damages, a breach of an ethical obligation to a client can provide vindication with a lower standard than a full legal malpractice litigation."

1827704,"There appears to be a lot going on, but addressing your question regarding bail, usually a third party contacts a bail bondsman on behalf of the incarcerated individual and sets-up the bail.  An inmate can call a bail bondsman and ask that person to do pretty anything.  So, yes, it is possible that his money was brought to him or the bail bondsman posted the bail and got paid after being released.  More likely a third party on the outside assisted in some way."

1801835,"How long was your wife in Arizona before she filed? If it was less than 90 days, jurisdiction probably was improper and you should consult with a local family law attorney whose experience includes post-decree matters.  Jurisdiction is a term that broadly refers to the power of a specific court to issue a ruling. In your case, there are two relevant types of jurisdiction. The first, personal jurisdiction, is the court‰Ûªs authority over the parties. By defending against the case here, you consented to personal jurisdiction and waived the right to challenge it now.  Conversely, subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived. Historically, Arizona courts treat the marriage itself as a property. The court must find that either party resided in Arizona for 90 days prior to filing the petition in order to establish its authority to dissolve the marriage.   I strongly encourage you to speak with a family law attorney as soon as you can. You‰Ûªll be able to quickly discern whether or not jurisdiction was properly asserted. If you find that it wasn‰Ûªt, you can file a motion (ARFLP Rule 85/FRCP Rule 60) to set aside the judgment."
1830282,"First of all, if you want a divorce you do not need your husband to agree or consent to a divorce, though it would make it easier, less expensive, and faster. You also do not need a basis for the divorce ‰ÛÒ the fact that you are convinced it‰Ûªs over is enough for the courts to conclude the marriage should be dissolved. As for abuse, there are many different kinds of abuse, but I assume you are talking about physical abuse. Physical abuse can be addressed either: 1) as a criminal matter by filing criminal charges or calling the police to intervene during an outbreak of violence, 2) the matter can also be addressed as a civil matter by filing for a ""no abuse"" order under mgl 209A. If addressed as a criminal matter your husband will likely be arrested and have to face criminal charges and jail is a possibility depending on a variety of circumstances, including past history and severity of assault. The fact that he is mentally ill or on medication may be a mitigating factor, but not conclusive, and the courts are not noted for their sensitivity to mental illness. To file under mgl 209A you will have to convince a civil court that your husband poses a threat to you that places you in fear of immanent physical harm. If you convince the court (and the threshold is low), the court will order your husband not to abuse you. They may also order that he have no contact with you and that he vacate the marital home. The order is a civil order and there is no chance of incarceration ‰ÛÒ unless your husband violates the order which is a criminal infraction. The civil court will be even less understanding or forgiving of your husband‰Ûªs mental illness than the criminal court. It sounds as though your husband is already attempting to address his problems, but he is not very successful. The 209A order may convince him that he needs to make a stronger effort or seek alternate treatment. The criminal approach will do little for your husband, but it may offer you more protection. There are a number of domestic shelters and programs in Massachusetts and it would behoove you to consult with one of them and develop a sound safety plan."
1961145,"We couldn't possibly answer this question with any intelligence, because there are enough holes in the facts to drive the Titanic through: 1.  What was the child arrested for? 2.  How old is the ""child?"" 3.  Is the ""child"" being charged as an adult? 4.  Does the charge involve Disability Fraud, SSI Faird, Medicare Fraud or some other kind of benefit fraud? 5.  Is the child entitled to the SSI benefits in the first place?  Since the child is facing arrest on criminal charges, then the child needs a Criminal Defense attorney immediately.  In addition, your friend should ask about the implications of those charges on the ability of the child to continue to collect benefits.  Hypothetically, if the child is arrested on Aggravated Assault Charges, is 17, and is collecting for disability, it would seem unlikely that the ""child,""  would continue to be eligible, but we have less than the full facts, so any answer we give would be purely speculative."

1809636,"My colleagues may be correct...or maybe not.  First, I doubt she can just disclaim responsibility for maintenance/repair.  She can, perhaps, exclude the use of the pool from the lease but if it is not specifically excluded, I don't think she can include it in what you rent and then deny responsibility to maintain it.  Secondly, ORS 90.320 provides that a landlord must provide, keep, and maintain all buildings, grounds, appurtenances safe for normal and reasonably foreseeable uses...does that cover repairing a pool in the yard?  Or perhaps a mandatory removal of the pool and it's frame if it is not going to be repaired?  Hmm...I think you at least have an argument depending in part upon how ""portable"" this pool is - can it be taken up and down relatively easily or is it pretty much a ""fixture""?  Most of all, I would want to be sure there is no reasonable way to interpret her proposed new lease to mean that you are responsible for the maintenance/repair of the pool - either now or as a result of future deterioration.   There may not be a definitive answer, known ahead of having a Judge or Jury decide the issue, but if pressed, you may want to at least discuss the issue with a local landlord-tenant attorney.

1814106,Running from juvenile probation or any form of probation rarely turns out well.  Warrants don't go away and they tend to rear their ugly heads at the most unfortunate of times.  If you know you have an outstanding warrant or pending probation violation it is always better to deal with then to run from it.  Contact an attorney in your jurisdiction for assistance.

1803433,"There are many reasons that the probate administration is taking some time.  In Wyoming, a probate can easily take up to a 18 months even no one is contesting the assets.  It's possible that appraisals and valuations take a while, they may have a different creditor issue, they may be waiting on the court.  If you want a better look at the matter, I recommend you checking out the court file and contact the attorney administering the estate to discuss what steps are still needed to distribute the assets."

1799646,"It depends.  If you are receiving the income generated by a trust, that income is taxable as ordinary income to you.  However, if you are receiving the principal of a trust, that is excluded from your taxable income (gifts and inheritances are specifically excluded from taxable income under Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code).  If you are not sure whether you are receiving trust income or trust principal, ask the trustee.  Washington State has no income tax, so neither trust income nor trust principal would be taxable at the state level."
1823726,"If you applied for a permanent job and were not chosen even though you have greater experience, you should try and find out why this happened.  It sounds like the office agreed to hire the two other employees to get them into the state pension system.  One is vested with over ten years of prior service and the other is almost vested.  You have no time in the pension system.  If they made the decision based upon this criteria, it is not illegal discrimination.  If you think you were discriminated against for an illegal reason, you should speak to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination or talk to a lawyer.  The second issue of your being an independent contractor is complicated and may need a legal review.  If the office has employees who are nurses, it is a problem to also have contract employee nurses.  However, if the contract employees just come in from time to time when it is really busy or there is a staff shortage, it might be acceptable.  It also matters if you are a contractor through an agency (and you get W-2 from the agency) or if you are a 1099 contractor directly with the office.  If you have concerns about your contractor status, you should speak to an employment lawyer.  Good luck."
1814630,"If you both haven't signed and agreed to the contract, you should probably be able to back out. I would act on this as soon as possible as time is of the essence. You do need to inform them in writing that you wish to back out of the contract."
1628536,"A private employer may decline to hire one with a criminal record.  However, doing so can't be used to mask an illegal purpose.  For example, an employer cannot reject a candidate because of race, but use a criminal conviction as the reason.  Obviously, this would be hard to prove in most cases.  There is some guidance from the EEOC on this issue that may interest you.  More and more employers are not rejecting candidates on a blanket basis because of a prior criminal record.  Even the President has addressed this issue -- in his State of the Union address.  Public employers are probably more likely to follow this EEOC guidance than private employers."

1815096,"My take on the matter is that the lawsuit should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Your own copyright attorney, of course, needs to evaluate the matter based on all the facts.  The general rule is that a party who did not have standing to sue, or who did not satisfy a precondition to suit, may NOT manufacture standing or satisfy the precondition during the proceeding.  The suit must be dismissed whole cloth, without leave to amend, even if an amended complaint is subsequently filed that pleads facts satisfying standing or the precondition.  The Reed Elsevier case does not alter that rule.  The Supreme Court held in Reed Elsevier that ""Section 411(a) thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment under our precedents.""  The Court expressly chose to ""decline to address whether å¤ 411(a)'s registration requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit that ‰Û_ district courts may or should enforce sua sponte by dismissing copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works.""  The case was taken to resolve the circuit courts disagreement over whether the registration requirement in Section 411(a) was ""jurisdictional"" or merely established a precondition to suit. Contrary to one responding attorney's assertion otherwise, the Court did NOT hold that a trial court may adjudicate infringement claims of unregistered works  -- that is, works that do not satisfy the precondition set forth in Section 411(a).  Because Reed Elsevier did not alter -- or even address -- the rule that Section 411(a) imposes a mandatory precondition to bringing a copyright infringement claim, it leaves intact all the prior case law dismissing suits brought by copyright owners who did not at least apply to register the allegedly infringed work before filing suit. Those suits have historically been dismissed ‰ÛÒ and, yes, sometimes re-filed once the registration application was submitted  [or actually issues, depending on the rule in that particular jurisdiction].  But that would be a NEW lawsuit, not a continuation of the previous one.   Again, speak with your own copyright attorney. Good luck."
1816136,"Mr. Hood is entirely correct; no hearing can be conducted without you physically present in court.

1807749,"I was interested to try to answer your question also, mostly because I am a veteran also. I did a limited amount of research, and although there are some provisions that apply to veterans, it does not appear they are applicable in your situation. The 2008 credit is recovered over 15 years, or any remaining amount when the house is sold or ceases to be the taxpayer's residence, except the remainder is forgiven in the case of death of the taxpayer, or involuntary conversion (destruction). Since the payback provision is an addition to tax, it appears that if you are unable to pay it, the payback as well as any other taxes you owe, could be avoided if you qualify for a collection alternative, such as a payment plan or offer in compromise."

It will then be up to the judge whether to grant that or not (and they will likely have some other judge hear it since your judge is retired)  I like Jason's idea of requesting the transcript if only to show the new judge what the original judge intended.  Whether the new judge thinks you deserve it in light of everything that has happened is up to that judge.

1819445,"The question is: what makes you think he is ""retired?""  From your statements, it does not seem like he is ""retired.""  And beyond that question, the other question is, what is your ex-husband doing to modify your support order?  If your concern is that he is not going to pay your support obligation because he is ""retired,"" then you can only be assured until he takes action (i.e., not pay the support order, or he files to seek modification).

Since you cannot pay your credit cards anymore, they might go into collection. It is possible that they will not be able to collect anything from you due the type of your income and lack of assets. In order to avoid the collection calls and notices, you may want to consider sending the credit card issuers a cease and desist letter, demanding that they will not contact you for the purpose of collection by phone or by mail.

1827145,"If your association was truly optional, you cannot be made a mandatory member without your consent.  I have seen a number of communities work to convert from optional to mandatory, and it takes time and effort.  Keeping the amenities in the area up to date usually enhances your property value whether you pay dues or not, so that is something to consider.  Also, a number of associations I have worked with have addressed situations sucy as yours by obtaining a delayed consent - that is the owner consents to have his property covered by the mandatory covenants as of the sale of his home - that way the owner is not paying current dues, the association knows it has a mandatory member in the future, and the eventual purchaser of your home can't be shut out of the HOA or charged a high fee to join at a later date.  Consider all your options and all the ramifications, not just payment of current dues."
1820346,"Disregard thew $100 fee.  It was part of a civil demand which you were not obligated to pay and in fact should not have paid.  You are probably off the hook but if you want to know for sure if you have any criminal record, go online and pay a service to run a background check.  It will not be very costly.    Here is some information about civil demands:  There is a law in the state of Illinois which allows for civil action collection when there is a retail theft. Most people choose to ignore the demand. This demand is for money over and above any fine you pay in compliance with a court order. People may get a few more letters, each time asking for more, and then they stop. While the retailer can sue you, it is extremely rare for anyone to actually be sued. You do not owe any money unless you are sued and the retailer wins. This is a common ploy. Do not pay. If you do, you will be in the national retailers database which could affect your ability to get a job and could impact your life in other ways. If you are uncomfortable, hire a lawyer and have the lawyer write a letter. That should be the end of it.   Here is a good article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120347031996578719.html   The National Retail Theft Database is actually a voluntary list put together by different individual retailers. Further, any member that published the information on the list, can thereafter, remove it. Therefore, if you wish to have the entry removed, as you apparently do, your best bet would be to write a letter to the manager of the particular store and inquire as to what it would take for them to remove the entry.

1804860,"My answer varies from that of my colleagues, in that the date the statute of limitations begins to run for credit card debt can vary depending on what the credit card agreement specifies, and if no date is indicated, typically is 180 days from the last date payment was due. Also, payment of any amount, even if made after the statute of limitations has expired, restarts the statute of limitations all over again, so beware of offers to pay just a penny or dollar, as it will revive a cause of action that has passed, or give another 4 years of time to a statute that has not yet expired.  If a debt collector is contacting you as opposed to the credit card company itself, my advice would be to wait until contacted by the debt collector before taking any action, and then, have a consumer lawyer review the communication with the collector for potential violations of law that might prevent you from having to pay some or all of the amount demanded."
1825918,"If such a motion is granted, then the judgment will be removed. You will not have to plead your case if it is set aside.

It is possible they will not serve you again, but it is also possible that they will, sooner or later. It is also possible they will be beyond the statute of limitations by now."

That being said, the sentence would, in theory, remain the  same regardless as to weather they were originally merged because you are still left with sentencing on 1 count of Agg UUW, its just a different factor being used to convert the charge from UUW to Agg UUW.  You should call the attorney who handled the original matter in the trial court and make an appointment to sit down and discuss this in detail so that you can get a full understanding of what your facing and if there is any argument that may sway the state to reduce your charge to simple UUW but the remaining sections of the Agg UUW statute have been held constitution but have not been heard by the supreme court so additional arguments might exist  based on the specific circumstances of your case.

Here is what I wrote, which you marked ""Best Answer"" in your first inquiry:   They can refuse but without any money, they would dealer be hard pressed to enforce the contract unless they sue you. However, keep in mid that whatever verbal negotiations you conducted would be overridden by the writing.

However, in Florida if the biological father has not established paternity in a family law court he has no rights.  So the mother can move if she wishes.  However, if the biological father files a paternity action before the mother meets the residency requirement of the new state, there is a potential for the mother to be required to bring the child back to the state of Florida.  This is Florida law however.  You need to find out about the relocation statue in Louisiana if they have one.  Good luck.  Sincerely, B. Elaine Jones, Esq."

1788869,"As this is a very sensitive case, the wording of the settlement agreement must be carefully read.  First, if I were you, I would insist on a confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement (assuming the matter settles at the global settlement conference), which would prevent any parties involved in the conference from discussing the specifics of the settlement, including the amount.  Second, you should be sure the settlement agreement states that the insurer and its insured is ""not accepting any liability or fault"" and that the settling of the matter ""is not an indication or admission of fault.""  That would have no real effect except that any other defendants cannot point to it and say ""Oh look, she settled with that insurer.  That means their insured was at fault!""  Third and most importantly, you must make sure that the settlement agreement does not say anything about waiving your claims against third parties, namely, the physicians and hospital against which you have filed suit.  If you cover those bases, I don't see how the doctors/hospital will be able to hold that settlement against you."
1806255,"You should have received notice in the Court's child support order it probably directed support enforcement to garnish your wages.

Whoever approved of the CS garnishment may have been fired for not giving you proper notice.  And notice is required by law, as in the Constitution. Its called Due Process. So there's court rules and a garnishment statute that control this issue.  You should get credit for all the extra CS you paid to date, so gather up all your cancelled checks and get a proper accounting."

However, it is possible for you and your wife to file change of status applications to B-2 status for medical care reasons - just make sure that your applications are RECEIVED at USCIS prior to your last day of employment (hopefully your company will give you some advance notice of this).  Also, include a letter from your wife's physician stating that she cannot travel due to the late date of the pregnancy (or if you are laid off after the baby is born and you cannot leave the US because the baby cannot yet travel, the letter from the doctor can state this reason instead).  You should also provide evidence that you have the ability to cover the health care expenses with the application - such as health insurance cards or bank statements if you are paying out of pocket.  You should also state that you intend to leave the U.S. as soon as the doctor has cleared your wife and child to do so, that you are only staying here to deliver because you have to for medically necessary reasons, etc.  If your company has an immigration lawyer, perhaps they will be kind enough to have that lawyer prepare the applications for you as needed.

1785514,"Yours is a very complex situation, because there are state and federal laws that protect ""tenants,"" but none that protect ""squatters.""  A ""tenant"" is simply a person who leases a piece of property from its owner or a designated agent of the owner. To be a tenant entitled to protection under Chapter 83 of the Florida Statutes, or the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009 (""PTFA""), the people occupying the premises would have to provide documentation to prove that (1) they had a valid lease with the previous owner, (2) they paid an amount of rent that was not substantially less than fair market value, and (3) they are not related to or in some advantageous relationship with the prior landlord.   If the occupants can provide proof of the above, then they must be given at least 90 days' notice from you to vacate, if you intend to personally occupy the property. If you do not intend to make the property your primary residence, then the tenants have either 90 days, or until the expiration of their lease.  If, however, the occupants cannot provide such proof, then you have a couple of options, including asking the Court which presided over the foreclosure to issue a Writ of Possession, or calling the Sheriff's Office and asking them to remove the people as trespassers. Because they are not ""tenants,"" an eviction action could be defended by them on the ground that there is no landlord-tenant relationship, so the options stated above are probably your safest, most direct routes.  You can speak with the people in your house, but many tenants are under the mistaken belief that once a house is sold at foreclosure, they acquire some right to simply remain in the property and not pay rent. They may even become belligerent and dare you to take them to court, so I would suggest sending a letter to the property introducing yourself, providing them with an opportunity to prove they are bona fide tenants, advising them that they will have to pay rent to remain in the meantime. To do this properly, I would advise you speak with a real estate attorney, however, as you want to furnish a notice that complies with the PTFA. A few hundred dollars would be a reasonable fee, and the time frame can range between a few weeks to a few months, depending on how you proceed.  I hope this information has been helpful, and wish you the best of luck."
1800409,"Make the potential licensee sign a non-disclosure agreement.  You would still need to be careful about how far your negotiations go to make sure they wouldn't be considered an offer for sale.

You should talk to an attorney about how you would structure the discussion to be safe.    Also, if you are only concerned about U.S. protection, you have a one year grace period to file an application."

1798676,"It is possible that your husband would qualify for Disability Benefits from Social Security. However, the Social Security process is not immediate, and it normally takes from 3 to 8 months for a decision in the Philadelphia area. In order to potentially qualify for benefits, your husband has to be able to prove that his medical conditions are severe enough that they have either already prevented him from working for 12 months, or will prevent him from working.  Luckily for your husband, his age puts him in the easiest category to be approved for benefits. If he were under 50, he would need to be able to establish that his condition prevents him from performing all full-time work. Since he is 60, the most important question is whether his condition will prevent him from performing the work he has done during the past 15 years, and whether he retains any transferable skills that will allow him to perform easier work.  It is important that your husband discusses his condition with his physicians. If they feel that he could return to his past work, it would be difficult to be approved, and if they release him back to work, it would probably be in his interest to try to return to work. If his physicians agree that he is unable to work, and he is significantly limited in his lifting and standing, and he agrees that he cannot return to work, he should definitely consider applying for Social Security Disability Insurance.  It is important to realize that even if he does qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance, an individual is not eligible for payments for the first 5 months that they are unable to work as a result of the disability. This 5 month waiting period normally becomes closer to 6 months, if he became unable to work after the 1st of the month. If the disability begins after the first of the month, there is a 5 month waiting period from the day he became unable to work, and then since eligibility for payments cannot begin in the middle of the month, payment eligibility does not begin until the 6th month. This means that if an individual last worked January 5, 2014, are found disabled on that date, their disability eligibility doesn't actually begin until July 2014. Since Social Security doesn't pay you until the month after your eligibility, a July payment would not be received until August. This means that for someone found disabled, their first payment is not usually received until 7 months after their disability began at the earliest.  I would recommend that your husband immediately speak to an attorney to determine if his is a good candidate for disability. If he potentially qualifies for SSI, it is important to apply as soon as possible, as individuals sometimes can be found disabled and be qualified for SSI payments even during the waiting period for SSDI. I wish your husband good luck!"

1808509,"Easy..you tell the truth. You list the vehicle in Schedule B and after year make and model, I would add"" I own vehicle equitably, but legally in anothers name , but I make all payments on it and $    is owed"". Then  In Schedule D list the family member as in reality your agreement with them is a debt , and you list them as secured on vehicle as they own it legally, you own it equitably, and list the amount owed. Normally, your vehicle may be worth less than is owed on it and thus no equity in Schedule C; if equity, list it there too. Then , in the statement of financial affairs #14 list the vehicle also and state you own it equitably, they legally.   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

You are beyond dealing with the Plaintiff's entitlement to have the judgment.  What you must now do is become aware of what the Plaintiff's rights are to use the legal process to collect money from you.  I hate to use the cookie-cutter answer that you should consult with an attorney, but here I will.  The particulars of your situation, what you own, what your income is, what your source of income is, and so on, that should be discussed face-to-face with a lawyer.  Your being the only source of income in your household would tend to have significance, but that too would depend upon the particulars of your household--who else in the household, if anyone? what is their relationship to you? do they receive government benefits? do you receive child support from a parent? and so forth."

1818047,"Under Oregon law, it is a crime to have sexual contact with anyone who is under age 18, because the law assumes that someone under that age cannot effectively give consent. However, if both partners are over age 15 and are within 3 years of one another's ages, then their ages can be an 'affirmative defense' to a charge of a sexual offence if that charge is based solely upon lack of consent due to age. An affirmative defense is not, strictly speaking, a bar to prosecution. It is a defense that the defendant must raise if a prosecution does occur.   That said, it is relatively common for relationships of this sort to occur and prosecutions are rare. Prosecutions cannot be brought about just because parents are angry. Private citizens have no legal authority to compel criminal charges. Charging crimes is the sole province of the police and district attorney. Private persons, including crime victims (or parents of crime victims) can report alleged crimes to police and can cooperate with the DA in their investigations, but that's all they can do. There is no such thing as ""pressing charges"" for most citizens.   Note also that none of this protects someone from prosecution for other sex-related crimes. So while sexual contact between an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old may be legal in Oregon, it requires both to freely consent. Practice enthusiastic consent, use protection and birth control, and be honest at all times."

1812073,"It's not strictly a ""double jeopardy"" issue, but what they may be referring to is a Kellett issue (Kellett v. Superior Court (1966) 63 Cal.2d 822).  Essentially, that case says that if there has been a prosecution that results in a final judgment, then any charges arising from that same incident should not be allowed.  That applies to any charges that were known or should have been known about at the time of the first prosecution.    This has been litigated previously (see In re Dennis B; People v. Arellano) and fails.  Because the prosecutor plays little to no role in the filing of an infraction that is not an included offense to a DUI, it's unlikely that this argument will prevail.  Would your case be different?  Maybe.  Could there be something on/connected to your citation that indicates there was a DUI?  There's at least an argument that the government (or at least some branch of it) knew that the DUI was in the same incident as the citation.  The problem is that an infraction for the tags is not an ""included offense"" to DUI.    Would it confound the prosecution?  Perhaps.  If you really want to pursue this avenue, you'll need an attorney to be on board with this and may want to start your case right with a plea of ""Once in Jeopardy"" rather than a straight not guilty.  (See Penal Code 1016)"
1933392,As some of the other attorneys mentioned - finding an attorney who handles DUI often gives you a better chance to reduce the charge. The plea doesn't just get better because you have no past.

It's at least worth your time to consult with an attorney before deciding.

Consider Google, headquartered in California, and IBM, headquartered in New York. Does it seem likely that the only way a lawyer could draft a contract between Google and IBM is if the lawyer is admitted in both California and New York? Definitely not.  The question is whether the lawyer is competent in the area of law, and if the lawyer is licensed in the jurisdiction where he or she is practicing. Where the client resides doesn't matter."

1806561,"A second conviction or PBJ will result in the MVA attempting to suspend your license for 30 days.   You can request a hearing to fight the suspension and the judge can reduce or modify the suspension to allow you to drive to work or school.   If you plead guilty,  you will end up being found guilty or with a PBJ.  You should therefore plead not guilty.   If the officer does not appear,  you will be acquitted.   If the officer is present, you will almost certainly be convicted unless you have an attorney.   In summation,  there are two ways to avoid the suspension.   You either have to be acquitted of the speeding ticket or you must fight the suspension at an administrative hearing."
1803214,"In California, once the N-400 is received it GENERALLY takes about a month to a month and a half to receive the biometrics notice and another 2-3 months after that to get the interview notice. But understand that all this can vary widely from case to case. Unfortunately there is no formula. We wish we knew ourselves, but it's not so easy.. Had a case where client was scheduled for biometrics within 2 weeks,'while another took more than 2 months to receive. Interviews also vary widely."

1810314,The parenting plan always cites the statute on relocation. Was that stricken from the parenting plan you executed?
1819153,"The concern I have, based upon first hand experience, is that your car payment will not be considered *current* by your auto finance company.  The payments by the Trustee could be behind your original schedule, or at a lower interest rate, or otherwise different  than what your contract suggested.  If you try to reaffirm with your payments different than your contract then the auto company may refuse to do so.  If you had a bankruptcy attorney when you filed, now would be a good time to meet with them.  Reviewing the published payment history on the trustee's site and a copy of your original contract should give you an idea of whether the car payments are on-time or not."
1799472,You very well may have a case.  Contact a well-respected litigator immediately.
1796800,You need to hire counsel -- you never want to deal with CPS on your own because they have broad powers.
1824350,"I know it is a tough situation to need a lawyer and not be able to afford one, but it is one of those emergency situations which people should try to save for.  I would compare it to needing a new roof, needing to replace a car transmission, or having an unexpected pregnancy. None of these are situations that anyone anticipates, but occur anyway. The only real answer is to save for a rainy day. Some people take out loans to pay their attorney or borrow money from family members, but again, that would be what they would have to do for any other unexpected situation."
1804231,"I am sorry to hear that you are going through this incredibly frustrating situation.  The good news is that you certainly do have rights.  I will attempt to give you a brief overview of what you can try to do on your own and how the law can help if you want to file a lawsuit.  Due to the different parties involved (dealer and manufacturer) and the complexity of Ohio and federal law on ""lemon"" RVs, my guess is that you will most likely need to engage an Ohio lemon law attorney to negotiate with the manufacturer and/or file a lawsuit on your behalf.  First, it will be helpful to have as much documentation of every problem with the RV as possible.  So keep a diary of sorts in which you note every problem as it occurs, including all pertinent details.  Keep a ""log"" of your communications with the dealer and/or manufacturer.  Keep all your repair paperwork every time the dealer comes out and any time any other work is done on the RV.  You can try to negotiate with the manufacturer on your own.  I would write a detailed letter to the manufacturer explaining all the issues with the RV and all the attempts that have been made to fix those problems.  Also state in your letter (generally referred to as a ""demand letter"") what you are requesting.  State whether you want a replacement (of the same model or a different model) or whether you simply want your money back.  It will take the manufacturer some time to respond to your demand letter, so you may want to follow up by phone (though I understand your efforts to communicate with the manufacturer so far have not been successful).  Complain as hard as possible and see what they are willing to offer you.  If they do make you an offer, they may want you to pay a ""mileage"" fee and/or pay the difference in sticker price between your current model and the new model.  Ohio's Lemon Law does not require you to do either of those things, but of course that will not stop them from trying to negotiate that with you.  Ohio's Lemon Law applies to RVs (though it only covers the ""chassis"" portion and does not cover things like the refrigerator, for example).  I would need more information to tell you whether the Lemon Law would apply to your situation.  Additionally, there are other legal claims you can make against the dealer and/or manufacturer - violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (Ohio's most significant consumer protection law), violation of the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act (sometimes referred to as a ""federal lemon law""), breach of contract and breach of warranty (depending on the warranties you received when you purchased the RV).  Some of these laws allow you to recover attorney fees from the dealer/manufacturer if you sue them in court and win.  As with the Lemon Law, I would need more detailed information from you in order to give you more complete feedback on your potential legal claims against the dealer and manufacturer.  Not a lot of lawyers practice in this area, so you would be best served by finding a consumer protection attorney with experience in lemon law and warranty law.  There are a few of us who practice throughout Ohio and would be happy to review the case for free.  If you want to take legal action, it is important that you move quickly because of the ""statute of limitations."" You have likely heard that term; however, if you haven't, it basically means that you only have a limited amount of time in which you can file a lawsuit, and after that time run out, your rights expire.  For lawsuits under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, the statute of limitations is two years.  So however you decide to proceed, move quickly.  Good luck."
1807249,The statute of limitations on misdemeanors is 1 year and felonies generally are 5 years with notable exceptions. There is no DUI as I understand it unless you were convicted of 23152a or 23152b? The fact that you are on probation means you were convicted of something. I doubt they will seek out the Sacramento file because they really don't care under these circumstances if you are not going to be charged as you say because the charges were dropped. Does the DA always see your prior criminal history including dates of conviction and for what ? YES. They have seen your history!  You will need to do the classes or go without a license so do them. Good luck. Hope this helps?
1827633,"Yes, you can take a lump sum but because it sounds like you will have future medical needs you should speak to an experienced work comp attorney before agreeing to a settlement. Also, they will have to pay you for your permanent impairment and you will need an experienced eye to know if the amount they offer is fair."
2355476,Sounds from your narrative that you may have a viable defense.
1805817,"If you know you were already approved for both, then you either HAVE the written determination or you received a phone call from the adjudicator.  Typically, you will get 2 notices of approval, one for each.  Then, you will get 2+ letters describing what is owed you, re back benefits, if any and prospective benefits.  I say PLUS, because with SSI, that amount can be changeable if they learn you come into varying other moneys (including SSDIB).  So you can get letters well into the future on the SSI.  I don't know who or which offices are currently doing calculations, since they seem to vary depending on case loads and they move around (different MODS, etc different regional offices).  But if you are dual eligible, it tends to take LONGER as a result.  Congrats you your win."
1821782,"I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you consult with an experienced family law attorney immediately. There are several serious legal issues issues involved, here, including the mother's  relocation of the child apparently in contradiction of  PA law. There are a number of thoughtful and very experienced family law attorneys who are in Philadelphia and who are regular contributors n this site. Search Find a LaAwyer if you're interested in contacting one of them."
1795663,"If she is already at Chowchilla, it means there is already a conviction and prison sentence and there are a lot of rules regarding habeas petitions and appeals so it is important that she obtain help from someone knowledgeable and not do this herself. See if she can have counsel appointed for an appeal (short timelines for filing) or habeas petition (lots of deadlines and procedural rules). Good luck to her."
1918563,"Technically the Father would not know unless he found out some other way. The Courts won't tell him unless you are trying to get child support from him. He would be informed then that you are claiming he is the Father. You could potentially not tell Father for the entirety of the child's life, but that is probably not in the best interests of the child."
1821383,"Every state has different laws and rules about divorce. You have clearly been looking at information for several states. If you have written your own decree based on these, it is almost certainly wrong. PLEASE get a lawyer to review and rewrite your decree before you submit it. This is even more important if you own anything or have children.   Right now it's as though you read the rules for checkers, but page 3 was actually the rules for monopoly.  You are not ready to play either game. You have rules from various states, and are almost certainly not ready for Texas court."
1800865,"I hate to say this, but as an adult, your record is likely NOT being ""expunged and sealed"".    California does not have a true ""expungement"" statute where they will wipe the case off your record.  Similarly, you cannot seal adult records.    Licensing agencies, such as the BRE, can look at arrests and the conduct, not just convictions.  You'd be well served to sit down face to face with a licensing attorney to discuss your status, your application and how to best proceed.  The worst thing you could do would be to fail to disclose this and get rejected because they think you falsified the application."
1798139,"The police investigate criminal offenses and submit reports to prosecutors.  The prosecutors file formal charges with the court.  The court signs an arrest warrant ordering the cops to go pick you up and bring you to court if everything submitted by the prosecutors to the court adds up to ""probable cause"" that you committed a crime.  So the detective doesn't file formal charges himself, but the paperwork he submits will eventually lead to criminal charges in most cases.  So chances are, you're eventually going to be looking at a criminal charge and an arrest warrant.  Hire a criminal defense attorney as soon as you can and you may be able to avoid getting picked up on the arrest warrant."
1790904,Keep in mind that the crude fraud you describe was actually carried out by you.  The burden of showing you did it at the behest of your lawyer will be on you.  You might not want to start down that road without a writing or email showing the advice.  Do not add to your own pain.
1829105,"The answer would largely depend on if there was currently a custody order in place or not. If there is, then your parents really can't be a party to violating it, if there isn't, then so long as your father agreed, you could go live with him."
1807013,"Consumer defense. Often time you can negotiate a pre-lawsuit settlement, or you may have several other options as well. One would need much more information."
1798993,"If you return during the validity of your H4, there will be no problem.  Your H1 status is already approved, so the change will take effect on Oct. 1 as planned.  The next time after that that you leave the U.S., you will need to get an H1 visa stamped in your passport."
1808155,"Any type of DUI conviction will kill your CDL.  Even if you take a plea agreement for reckless driving (and that's not very likely in most jurisdictions), it will probably still result in a suspended license and automatic loss of CDL."
1808825,"Generally, creditors will not sign a satisfaction before receiving payment, therefore, many attorneys who handle probate matters will send the satisfaction, with the payment, with an indication on the check that the payment is being made in full satisfaction of the claim."
2065153,You need a litigation attorney.  Give me a call this morning.
411135,"You can contact the State Police yourself for a background check.  Alternatively, you can contact an attorney. Rates vary by attorney.

1793584,"I am assuming there is no Judgement against you for this debt. If not, the statute of limitations in Florida for breach of contract is 5 years."
1804632,"It would be hard to say one way or the other without reviewing the entire search warrant and the police reports to see what they based the warrant on. There may be more issues here than just the wrong date. You would need an attorney to review these things and tell you and your daughter what legal issues are present to use as defenses.  It is worth fighting this and being thorough about it. If your daughter gets convicted then that can be used as proof of liability in a civil suit, and perhaps even proof of greater liability. The insurance companies may also hold it against her.  These answers are general information about the law and they are not legal advice about how to handle a specific case, since we don't have all the facts of your situation. You need to contact one of the Minnesota attorneys directly in order to get help with your actual situation. This helps you identify the important things you should discuss with the attorney who you contact. Feel free to ask follow up questions too, but remember that no attorney-client relationship is formed through Avvo unless you contact an attorney directly to sign an agreement for representation."
1802332,"There's no provision for sealing adult criminal records.  Offenses can be expunged, but the 2 offenses you describe would not be eligible for that.  You could seek a gubernatorial pardon, but I don't believe Gov. Walker has pardoned anyone during his term or even established a review board for the process."
1811466,"Mortgage companies and banks are ridiculous these days.  The power of attorney does not ""expire"" unless the terms of the document state that it does.  The notary expiration is not relevant- it is just when the notary needs to renew their notary license.  All a notary does is collect information to attest the person signing is the person they say they are, nothing more. Logic would dictate that it is more likely your mother was competent 6 years ago than today, right? Find another mortgage company (if you can) or hire a lawyer."
1801030,"I agree with both counsel who responded:  1.  You can simply re-file the RFO noting very clearly that it is amended to address this additional issue. 2.  But before doing so, you should run support figures to know the impact of your request AND consult your Tax Expert to determine the tax benefits of this change.  It might be that the award of child support outweighs the potential tax benefit, such that it would be better to not disrupt the status quo."
1904557,"You are required to report the accident to your car insurance company. If you are sued, they will then provide you with an attorney at no cost to you. The only potential problem I see is whether you have enough insurance to cover the claim if you are sued, which is a function of the amount of ""bodily injury"" coverage that you purchased and the extent of the injuries suffered by the other person."
1805541,"If you need to hire your own civil litigation attorney and have a limited income, contact the state Bar of Arizona and ask about the Modest Means program to see if you qualify for a reduced price attorney.  But really any attorney who practices in the area of general civil litigation can assist you.  The rub is that since you are the defendant, you are going to need to come up with an advance fee that the attorney can bill against."
1824800,"Generally you have a year to file a workers compensation claim from the date that the injury occurred or when you knew it was work related.   There may be exceptions if your employer provided you medical treatment after the incident or you informed your employer of the injury, but they failed to provide a claim form.  But in all likelihood, your time to file has expired if it has been more then one year since the injury."
1803599,"You could have several possible causes of action depending upon the remaining circumstances that caused you to be in the room at all and why they were refusing to allow you to leave.  You should contact an attorney for a consultation about these issues to determine the next step to take.  If there should be federal discrimination laws in play here, you have a limited time to assert your rights in Arkansas (180 days).  Failing to assert these rights during this time period will result in those rights expiring."
1822412,"Generally, a notice to pay rent must be issued, and followed by an eviction lawsuit to regain possession. The issue could become more complicated if the tenant has a written lease and/or he starts paying rent once given notice. I highly recommend having an attorney help you with the process."
1801261,"No, this is not a good reason for a re-schedule.  Plus, be careful of what you ask for.    If you're trying to avoid the 2 year conditional situation imposed by the Marriage Fraud Act ... you may get a super-intense interview by a Fraud Officer."
1825750,"A prosecutor is obligated to speak with a victim regarding sentencing options for a case.  What a victim wants may not be what a victim gets.  If there is a huge disparity and its a serious case, then you may want to speak with the prosecutor's supervisor.  The Judge really doesnt play a role in this issue other than to ensure that you have an opportunity to address the court prior to sentencing if that is your wish.  Normally a Judge just asks a prosecutor if a victim has agreed to a deal and if the victim wanted to present for sentencing or to make a victim impact statement"
1830460,"3-4 months probably, if everything is ok. Good luck!"
1814130,"I think you've asked this once before.  If not, I apologize...  Unless one of these charges carries a life sentence, he is NOT facing 25-life under the three strikes law for catching 3 strike offenses in this one case.  The potential 25-life sentence is for someone who already has 2 prior strike convictions and then gets convicted of a new strike offense.    Most strikes carry a presumptive prison sentence.  That means that it is presumed they will be going to prison.  But like every presumption, it can be overcome and the judge can grant probation on *most* offenses.  Whether they will or not depends on the facts, the charges and the circumstances of the offenses.  It also matters what his attorney can do for him to convince the DA or judge to give him probation (assuming he's convicted at all)."
1826703,"If you are the Plaintiff and no action has been taken on your behalf for over 5 years, the lawyer has violated a Rule Regulating the Florida Bar.  You need to contact counsel and ask what has happened. Also, if nothing has happened in the case and you are prejudiced as a result thereof, you have a Bar Complaint that you can file. Forms are available at www.FlaBar.org   Again, if your own lawyer has neglected this file for so long, you need to find another attorney."
1816121,"You raise a couple issues here that need to be addressed:  1. To answer your explicit question, no, they cannot issue a withholding order against your soon-to-be-spouse's wages. He has no obligation to your children with another person.   2. If you are paying child support and directly providing for your daughter you are in effect paying child support twice for your daughter. You may not mind paying the extra child support but you should know, as the child support office explained, you can modify the existing support and possession orders to reflect the current situation. You would be entitled to a reduction of child support because your daughter lives with you. You could also pursue support from your ex for your daughter as an offset against your support for the two boys and further reduce the amount you owe. Of course, you can always give more money for the boys as you wish but your court-ordered amount could be reduced."
1661273,"Jurisdiction is the power of the court to hear a matter.  There are roughly two parts to jurisdiction: subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.  Subject matter jurisdiction is the ability of the specific court to hear the type of case or to adjudicate matters against one of the parties.  Personal jurisdiction is the power of the court over the individual defendant.  In your case, they most likely held that the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants, as in they lacked minimum contacts with the forum jurisdiction and dismissed the case so you could bring it again in a place where the parties could be sued, such as federal court or a court in one of the defendants' forums.  Venue is the distinction as to which court, in a jurisdiction, should hear the case - in New York, for example, the specific county or specific type of Court (Civil v. Supreme).  As you can see, this is a relatively complex area of law and you should speak to your attorney if you have questions."
1814765,"I agree with my colleague: your posting is incomprehensible.  Only the district attorney/city attorneys office ""files"" a criminal case. Individuals or their attorneys file civil cases."
1805231,"You can not collect for emotional distress.  However, if you can convince the judge that the case is frivolous or being litigated in bad faith, an Indiana statute allows recovery of attorney's fees.  You should discuss the issue with your lawyer. There is also an appellate rule that allows recovery of damages on appeal for a frivolous appeal or for procedural or substantive bad faith in the appeal."
1829147,"You correctly answered your own question and understood you are out of status. You'll need your school to reinstate your F-1 status.  But, for the life of me, I cannot understand why you'd want to even bother with reinstating your student status if you are to be wed with a US citizen soon and can apply for a green card immediately thereafter.  There is absolutely no need, as spouses of USCs are deemed to be ""immediate relatives"" (""IRs"").  IRs are not required to maintain valid status, and nor are IRs ever penalized for having engaged in unauthorized employment."
1807470,"ORC 2925.03(C)(3)(h) is an odd provision. It makes it a minor misdemeanor to give a gift of 20 grams or less. From what you describe, I doubt you were charged or plead to an offense under this section. It is far more likely you plead to a violation of 2925.03(C)(3)(a), the standard charge for selling, or transporting for sale, small amounts of marijuana. This offense is a fifth degree felony.  It will be extremely hard to withdraw your plea, modify your sentence or conviction, or attempt any kind of appeal at this point. If you want to try, you will need to hire an attorney to help you."
1808957,"No, your mother should petition you as soon as she can and establish your priority date."
1813896,"These are motions to be filed by your son's attorney.  Basically its a discovery request to either get them tested for fingerprints or to get custody of the evidence so you can hire an expert to analyze it.  There's is no guarantee a judge would grant this, however."
1813482,No worries. Change of address does not in any shape or form affect your 150/180 EAD eligibility. Your asylum clock will not be changed by USCIS.
1825071,"You should go to court and submit an order to show cause to ask for more time to move.  You need to detail why you need an extension.  Please note, that if this case is in Housing Court, the maximum time that the court can give you to move is six months.  If you already have been given from March through August, the Court can only give you one additional month to relocate."

1802420,You need to deny paternity and then submit a motion for paternity testing. This can become quite complicated since this case involves multiple children. I suggest that you meet with a local attorney to discuss your options. Many attorneys in the area provide free consultations and allow you to make payment arrangements in lieu of a large initial retainer. Good luck!
1808404,"Locate an experienced criminal defense lawyer in your area, who specializes their practice in DUI DEFENSE, make an appointment,  bring whatever evidence, documents or witnesses that you may have, engage in a meaningful face-to-face consultation.  Each case is different.  Get advice on your specific case and scenario.  Most on AVVO offer free consultations.  Best of luck to you."
1822429,"I would have to say that you should really contact an attorney to advise you properly before moving forward. You and your son have to be aware that these images are likely to be considered child porn (if these pictures are nude images of the girls they definitely are). As much as I appreciate and respect your moral obligation as a parent, I'd be careful.   I'd either block these girls' numbers from your son's phone, advise him of the dangers of these types of messages and do nothing further OR contact an attorney for specifics. Don't forget - people tend to shoot the messenger. If you do tell the parents, these parents aren't going to like what they hear about their daughters and who knows who they're lash out on. Be careful."
1786437,"Talk to an attorney immediately. Keep in touch with your daughter on Facebook and consider setting up an alternative method of contacting her, even if it is just a new email address. But establish a line of communication to stay in touch with her. If you do not know where your ex is planning on going, then you need to find out from your daughter if you can. An attorney can help you prohibit the relocation while the matter is fully litigated."

1824280,"Q: Can I motion default before or the states court date, or do I did it before? A: It depends on what the ""court date"" is. Normally a motion for default can be filed 20 days after filing and service. Q: Also, the other party never showed up to court or responded. We still don't know where they are. Do I have to serve them the default paperwork? A: If you don't know where they are, you have to get court approval to serve the Summons and Complaint per statute. I am assuming they were properly served and then dropped out of sight. If that's true, you normally don't have to give prior notice of your motion for default. Q: How do I do that if I don't know where they are? A: Whenever you are required to serve someone, you have to do so following the court state and local (county) rules. There are statutes and rule books that describe this procedure. Q: Do I have to do the parenting class before all pf this default, Dismissal stuff? A: look at your county's local rules. Normally the courts require the parenting class before entry of the final orders.

1809948,"Yes.  Landlord can sue you for the two months that you did not pay.  The law suit would be for damages and not for eviction as you already moved out.  An interesting aside, that you may not be aware of, is the landlord cannot keep your security deposit pursuant to Florida Statute 83.49(3)(a) unless he/she gave you written notice within 30 days of you leaving of his/her intent to do so and gave you an itemized breakdown of the damages/repairs.  If landlord does not send this letter he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim against the security deposit. In other words, you could actually sue the landlord for the security deposit.  Maybe you can use that as leverage to settle this matter.  Please look up this statute on-line.  Hope this helps.  Good luck."

1794743,"As to your first inquiry, there may be an alternative program you can avail yourself of by going in, with an attorney, and explaining the situation to the Court.  The result may depend on several things, including alternative sentencing programs, your current rapport with this Court (and prosecutor), which includes past compliance (e.g. progress reports, etc.).  An attorney will explain your circumstances to the Court and the prosecutor in attempting to attain this result.         Your second inquiry, re your leg injury, is an issue which appears may have a great deal of merit.  You probably have rights against one, if not several, parties.  Having litigated against both private and government entities, I think you may have a stronger case against the private party or parties involved in causing your injuries, and it may be more beneficial to you to pursue the private party or parties, rather than the Court.  Ultimately, there may be an insurance policy that provides some coverage for your injuries.  You need an attorney to flush out these facts and pursue the appropriate parties in obtaining compensation for what seems to be a serious injury.  Timing is of the essence, considering your statute of limitations (which is even shorter in government entity claims.  see G.C. section 913 et seq.), among other things."
1817257,"There could be several correct answers.  There may be an order in your case govenring when to disclose experts.  If not, review Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, which states a demand must be made no later than 70 days before trial (though it can be made earlier) and the designation must be made no later than 50 days before trial. This also assumes you are in state court rather than federal court"

If an application package has not been properly prepared or fully documented, however, the USCIS may send Requests for Additional Evidence, and that can cause significant delays in the adjudication process.

1805806,"I agree with Peter L. Klenk, but I would like to add something. I think your son should have a two pronged attack. Mr. Klenk has discussed one of the prongs. Of course, we do not know how much  your former husband's estate is worth.The insurance company will do nothing until the girlfriend files a claim. Then it will file an interpleader requesting to pay the money into court and letting your son and the girlfriend present their claims.  My suggestion is that your son sue the insurance company which will force the company to file an Interpleader. Your son could probably file the claim against the estate as suggested by Mr. Klenk. In either case I would suggest you should consider hiring an attorney. Many attorneys would agree to handle this on a contingent fee basis. You should probably consult a highly rated AVVO attorney who handles estate or large estate claims."

Now applying for either an O-1 (""Extraordinary Ability"" in your field of endeavor) or an L-1A (Since you are Greek and not Indian, I am assuming it's going to be an L-1""A"" multinational manager/intercompany transferee visa, as opposed to a ""B"" = ""specialized knowledge'.

As for the L-1A you can do the same and/or also visit the USCIS website, at least to gain some initial information.  The creation of a business entity either in Delaware or whichever other state will not establish whether or not you are eligible for either an O-1 or L-1A.  For the L-1A, by the way, you must have worked for at least one (1) full year out of the immediately preceding 3 in either a managerial or executive position for the parent, affiliate, subsidiary or joint venture of the Delaware Company which will be established.

1804623,"Possession of paraphernalia is a 1st degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in the local jail, but you'd have to be pretty unlucky (or a career criminal) to get that.    Being bounced out of diversion never looks good (note that I do not know the why of it - you might have picked up a new charge, failed a urinalysis, not completed a class, missed a reporting cycle, etc) but some reasons are ""worse"" than others.  Moreover, some diversion programs require you, as a condition of admittance, to execute an irrevocable confession, and if you did so then your defense to the underlying charge is probably shot to hell.  My advise to you is to get off line and into an experienced Naples area criminal defense lawyer's office asap.  Only by meeting with someone who can review your police reports and the Clerk's docket (and who hopefully has some knowledge of the practice and procedure of the relevant Court and State Attorney's Office) will you have a realistic idea of the likely consequences.  I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."
1828557,"I agree with Mr. Early regarding trying to get a Will drafted if your mother is still competent to sign legal documents.  Also, strongly consider having a Durable Power of Attorney drafted (and you may want to consider whether there should be a Health Care Power of Attorney and/or Living Will as well).  On the facts you have stated here, it would appear that absent some of these estate planning documents, nothing can be done until an estate can be opened and probated.  Undoubtedly she will benefit from having someone legally able to handle her affairs in the meantime.  Again, all of this is going to be contingent on mother being competent to sign legal documents.  I will also add that it may be possible for her to convey the house to the children and take that out of probate territory.  I do, however, want to also caution that getting help from an attorney experienced in elder law is desirable because one of the first things I would want to explore is whether your mother has accessed Medicaid benefits and possibly facing estate recovery claims."
1821642,"While you can always agree to the assessment, it is much more difficult to change your mind later than to continue and pursue the matter now. First, talk with your tax lawyer (or retain one) about the legal fees to file an appeal, if you have not already done so. The legal fees may be less than the additional amount the IRS says you owe. Owing a little bit to a lawyer is better than owing a lot to the IRS.   Second, look at your options right now. You can appeal the results of an audit to the IRS appeals division and it will be reviewed by a fresh set of eyes. IRS appeals is independent from the examination function, so if you had trouble with the auditor, you have a fresh start. If you've already appealed, you can file a petition in Tax Court. Remember, run a cost/benefit analysis of the legal fees versus the tax liability in controversy. And, you may obtain legal fees in your case. If you submit a qualified offer, the IRS rejects your offer, and the Tax Court determines that your original offer is correct, you could recover attorney's fees.  I would have a hard time telling someone to give up and pay unless the amount in controversy is so low that it is not worth the legal fees. There are many more avenues to pursue to dispute your tax liability than in this answer."

Please do not try to handle this own your own."
1823978,"There is a presumption of paternity in favor of the mother's husband.  The mother has to rebut that presumption if she seeks for you to be deemed the child's father.  The genetic marker test would have to be done to determine paternity on your part too.  The court is probably seeking to determine what the relationship between the husband and child is.   If the child knows only the husband as his father, the court may find that the husband is estopped from denying paternity.  On the other hand, if you are found to be the biological father of the child and have maintained any kind of relationship with the child, the court may find you to be the child's father.  It's a very fact sensitive type of case dependent upon the relationship between the child and alleged father(s).  You should be discussing these issues with your lawyer."

1825197,"When FMLA and ADA are involved the long story is very important. Issues involving these laws are complex and fact-specific. You certainly have issues whether your STD will be affected by employment elsewhere and whether employment elsewhere conflicts with your employer's rules regarding outside employment. Both of those issues are likely addressed by the STD plan documents and your employer's handbook, respectively. However, the most immediate issue is that the company's doctor is not releasing you back to work. That creates a problem not only for not being able to work but also an issue whether your employer has effectively terminated you because they will not let you return to work. That could implicate your rights under the ADA and your state's anti-discrimination laws. You need to talk to an employment lawyer about the long story and let him or her advice you regarding your next steps."
1801577,"Under California law, only your father's legal heirs at law may bring a case for Wrongful Death.  You are an heir, and your Uncle is not. Now obviously a claim for Wrongful Death contemplates just that, a death; it it must be shown to have been caused by the negligence of the nursing home staff.  As a right heir, you indeed have the legal right to bring such a claim, and so too would your siblings (they too could bring a claim).  But regardless of your fathers will/trust/estate, your uncle could not bring a claim for Wrongful Death. He would have no ""legal standing"" to bring such claim.

Theft under $50 is a class C Misdemeanor and only carries a $500 fine - No jail time. Since your theft charge was for only $80, if you do a theft class up front, sometimes the prosecutor will reduce the charge. Either way - if you want an Expunction - you need to get a PreTrial Intervention or a class C with a Deferred Disposition. Get a good criminal defense lawyer in the county that it happened in.

1659328,"First of all, they have not accomplished legally valid personal service on you by leaving it on your doorstep. They would have to have given it to someone over the age of 18 and is a family member, etc.  The bottom line is, without going into all the possibilities of effecting service, leaving it on the doorstep is NOT valid personal service in Colorado.  Second, if you are correct and it was the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs who left it on your doorstep, they cannot do that since they are parties to the action.  So, based on what you have said, you have not been personally served and, therefore, the Small Claims Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over you.  Now, here comes the tricky part, if you do ANYTHING with regard to the pending case except object to personal jurisdiction, you will be waiving the fact that the Court has no personal jurisdiction and will be submitting voluntarily to its jurisdiction. For example, and this is what Mr. Harkess is pointing out, if you simply show up at Court and begin to argue the merits of the case, you will have waived any objection to the Court's lack of personal jurisdiction.  If you do object to jurisdiction, the plaintiffs, if they are smart, will simply have you served then by a deputy in the Courthouse, or the Clerk, etc. So all you have done is postponed the inevitable.  Your best option is to simply face the complaint and get it dismissed. It sounds like they have no viable action against you anyway - are they seeking money damages in Small Claims Court for you testifying against their son? If they think you lied under oath, then they should be making a report to law enforcement for the crime of perjury. But filing a money damages lawsuit in Small Claims Court seems like quite a stretch.  Hope that helps.  Best of luck to you."

If the vehicle they were in was forced to crash because of the carelessness or recklessness of another car, then they may be entitled to Uninsured Motorist benefits under your policy. UM benefits include reimbursement for medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering and permanent injury. Ala law holds that an unknown vehicle that causes an accident is considered an ""uninsured motorist"" for purposes of a UM claim. Also, depending on the age of the children if the driver of the car they were in was negligent, they may have a claim against the driver. Given the seriousness of their injuries, I certainly would encourage you to consult with an experienced injury attorney about this matter. good luck and prayers for a good recovery for your children."
1786044,"As for medical reports, it usually depends on the reasons for the settlement as to whether final reports would be needed.  In many cases they are not.  An insurance company can take anywhere from hours to months or even years for highly complex settlements.   It sounds from your facts that perhaps the defense attorney and your attorney discussed what they thought was a reasonable settlement and it would be subject to your approval and the insurance company's approval.  If you have not heard anything, i would assume your case is not settling and continue with your treatment and any other medical examinations that are needed.  Find out  from your attorney what the current plan of action is.  If you have not been released by your doctors yet, then your attorney can not force a trial on permanent disability until that happens, or you are given final reports by an AME or a QME.  Talk to your attorney, their office will have the best understanding of your case."

1810556,"No, failure to pay a consumer debt is not a crime and does not subject you to criminal prosecution or punishment.    If a creditor wants to sue you for collection of a debt, the creditor must first file a lawsuit and then personally serve you with the summons and complaint.  If that happens you must respond to the lawsuit within 30 days.  Even if you do not respond to a collection lawsuit, you would not be guilty of a crime.  But the creditor could then seek to enforce the judgment in various ways, such as a levy on your bank accounts.    If it's been more than 4 years since you made any payments on these credit cards, its likely that the statute of limitations has run, and therefore it isn't likely that you'd be sued by the creditors.

1810351,"If this person has already entered a plea to the charge, then it is very likely that the court will proceed to sentencing after the warrant is executed (withdrawing the plea is not a likely option).  In many instances, where a person remains on bond (or ROR status) between the plea and sentencing hearing, the State will usually put on the record that the plea agreement is based on the defendant appearing for sentencing with no new law violations.   This means that whatever agreement was reached may no longer be on the table.  Also, when a person fails to appear for a mandatory court date (in felony cases), the State will usually file a subsequent felony charge for failing to appear.  This person should ask the court to appoint a lawyer (if h/she cannot afford one) to resolve both matters concurrently.  Good luck."

The law says you get one hour of pay for every violation.  The law requires your employer to give you a 30 minute duty-free meal break for every 5 hours of continuous work.  Aside from that if you are working 6 or 7 days per week, you are probably due over-time and also double-time pay as well as penalties.  The best thing to do is document.  You need some proof that you are not the one clocking out.  If your manager is clocking you out, on paper it could appear as if you are clocking yourself out.  Thus making it difficult to say that you didn't clock yourself out.  If on the other hand, you can prove you were elsewhere (making a delivery, not at work, etc...somehow through text...photos...time stamped emails... etc.) then you cannot be at two places at the same time.  Get creative.  The point is you have to document and prove that you didn't clock yourself out.  Don't worry if this becomes an issue.  There are other things that can be done...it just wouldn't hurt to have more evidence to back up your version of the story (because their version is probably going to sound a lot different).  Employment attorneys usually give free consultations.  Find one on here or through CELA.ORG.  Good luck to you."

If it was, then you could hire a new lawyer to see if there is a basis to get some or all of that money back.

1822056,"Read Mr. Sicuso's answer and consider the following additional thoughts: you need to know what the policy limits are, you need to give the carrier a reasonable chance to settle for the limits, and if you have UM, you need to figure out what those limits are too. Unrelated to your demand, be aware that if you have health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid, they likely have a right to be reimbursed for any of your medical bills they paid. About your claim: the value could be many times what the policy limits are, but if you demand more than the limits, you are doing yourself a disservice.  Again: Time limit demand. No unreasonable conditions. Call a lawyer for guidance. You may not need to retain the lawyer until after your demand expires. Good luck."
1665800,"Dear  ?,    The purpose of the first brief on appeal is for the appellant to convince the 3 judges on the court of appeal that there was one or more legal errors which made the proceeding in the superior court basically unfair.  The appeal court reviews only legal error, not factual error.  The appeal court is required to assume any factual dispute in the superior court was resolved in favor of the side that won the case.  That is, if your witness testified to one thing and the opponent's witness testified to the opposite, the appeal court is required to assume that the fact-finder, whether judge or jury, believed the witness for your opponent.. So, to recap, the appeal court will not decide credibility issues and will not overturn any explicit or implied factual findings of the court below.     What the appeal court can do is find that a legal ruling against you was in error and so prejudiced your case that you did not get a fair hearing.  BUT, the reviewing court cannot consider any legal issue unless you or your counsel objected to the ruling or the evidence or whatever in superior court.  If there is no objection on the record, you have not preserved your issue(s) for appeal.   With this background in mind, the selection of issues to argue on appeal is crucial.  I never raise more than six and it is rare for me to raise more than 2.  This is because, while there may well be more than six legal errors in a case, it is extremely rare for a case to have six prejudicial errors. Plus, the judges on the appeal court don't believe there can be six prejudicial errors in the same case.  How to choose the errors to make an issue out of on appeal is a skill it takes a long time to develop and I can't give you any help with that.     As far as outcomes, if you had a trial, the only thing the appeal court can do is reverse and remand for a new trial if it finds basic unfairness.  In rare cases, it can reduce the amount of damages awarded. If you lose, the judgment is affirmed and you have a right to petition the state supreme court to review the decision of the court of appeal.  This is not a right to have the high court hear your case as they can refuse to hear any case except a death penalty appeal.  If you win, you get a new trial.  Yours sincerely, Tim Provis Appellate Counsel Member: U.S. Supreme Court Bar"

If it has been 7 years since you made a payment, it may indeed be beyond the statute of limitations.  If so, and this is a debt for consumer purchases, it would be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for the collector to continue to pursue you for it.

1829229,"Much more would need to be known to fully answer your question.  For instance, your job and the kinds of seminars you are attending are important.  For instance, it is not unlawful for an employer of a professional, like an attorney, to require the employee to pay for seminars the attorney wishes to attend to improve the attorney's abilities because those seminars benefit the employee as much as the employer.  On the other hand, if you are required to attend a seminar by your employer that is a prerequisite of performing your job, your employer is required to reimburse you for those expenses that you incur.    There are several nuances to these laws.  If you want to know for sure, your only choice will be to locate and consult with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible to explore your facts and determine your options.  I would suggest you look either on this site in the Find a Lawyer section, or go to www.cela.org, the home page for the California Employment Lawyers Association, an organization whose members are dedicated to the representation of employees against their employers.  Good luck to you."
1819563,"Based on your comments following Mr. Pedersen's answer, you may have a remedy in the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). If your employer has at least five employees, it must comply withe the FEHA. Among other things, the FEHA forbids an employer to discriminate against or harass an employee BECAUSE OF his or her sexual orientation or disability.  This can be difficult because, of course, you do not know for sure what is in someone's thoughts or what the motivation is for the bad treatment. Is your boss treating you this way because you are a lesbian? Because you are a person with a disability? Or because the boss just doesn't like your personality?  Proving that the different treatment is due to your orientation or disability may be easy or may be difficult; without knowing details of your working conditions, it is impossible to speculate. If there are negative or teasing comments regarding your lesbianism or about homosexuality or LGBT issues in general, that gives you and an attorney something to work with.   If not, sometimes discrimination can be shown by differences in the way employees are treated, provided there is a large enough workforce for statistical differences to be significant.  For example, if there are 100 employees and 50 of them are out lesbians, and you are the only one who is receiving the bad treatment, it will be hard to show you are being treated differently because you are a lesbian. However, if there are 100 employees, 50 are women, 2 of you out lesbians and only the 2 of you are receiving adverse treatment, then there is something to pursue.   It is the same kind of inquiry with respect to your disability. Essentially, you need to rule out every other reason for the adverse treatment other than your lesbianism or disability.    Please look at my guide to unlawful discrimination:  http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=what-is-unlawful-employment-discrimination--california-law which should help you understand lawful and unlawful discrimination, how to enforce your rights, and time limits.   In addition, the FEHA requires an employer to provide an employee with a disability (as defined by the FEHA) with a reasonable accommodation for that disability. Please look at my Avvo guide on the ADA: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/disability-discrimination-in-employment.  http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/employment-disability-protection-under-californias-fair-employment-and-housing-act-and-federal-ada?published=true   It also possible you are being treated badly because your boss is a jerk. Unfortunately, employees have very few employment rights and employers have a lot of leeway in how they choose to run their businesses. In general, an employer can be unfair, obnoxious or bad at management. An employer can make decisions based on faulty or inaccurate information.  An employer has no obligation to warn an employee that he or she is not performing as the employer wants. It‰Ûªs not a level playing field. An employer hires employees to provide work for its benefit, not for the benefit of the employees. Don't expect the employer to take care of its employees; it doesn‰Ûªt have to and it rarely does.  There are some limitations on what an employer can do, mostly in the areas of public policy (such as discrimination law as indicated above, or whistle blowing), contract law, union-employer labor relations, and constitutional due process for government employees. Please see my guide to at-will employment in California which should help you understand employment rights: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/an-overview-of-at-will-employment-all-states.  After you take a look at the guide, you may be able to identify actions or behavior that fits one of the categories that allows for legal action.   (continued in Comment below)"

It also depends to some extent on what your relationship with that Realtor was, if they were seller's agent or both or your agent.

And as Mr. Lapin pointed out, if it involves the survey/title commitment, those too have deadlines (which likely passed) and if you miss them by a day, you are out of luck.

1808722,"The Texas Arbitration Act (Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code section 171.001, et seq.) provides the following:  (a)  A written agreement to arbitrate is valid and enforceable if the agreement is to arbitrate a controversy that: (1)  exists at the time of the agreement;  or (2)  arises between the parties after the date of the agreement. (b)  A party may revoke the agreement only on a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.  Here is a link to the Arbitration Act:  http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.171.htm.  Except in very limited situations dealing with preemptive federal statutes (such as ERISA), arbitration agreements related to employment are enforceable in Texas.

1708931,"Litigation is a specialized skill.  Often, self-represented litigants make procedural mistakes that cause them to lose their case without even getting to the merits.  Trial procedure is not intended as a trap for the unaware; it is an evolving, time-tested method toward the goal of a a fair trial.  Filing and serving a lawsuit is not all that one needs to do.  There is a discovery, motions, and subpoena process with their own deadlines.  If yours is a jury trial, there needs to be jury instructions and voir dire preparations.

1797947,"Tennessee prosecutors will often pursue a case, even if the alleged victim wishes to drop the case.  This is a common issue in domestic violence cases, in particular, as alleged victims often wish to drop such charges.  However, the State often believes the alleged victim is in need of protection, and will thus move forward despite the victim's lack of cooperation.  An alleged victim in this situation may be able to work with the defendant's attorney to help get the case dismissed, by explaining what happened to the attorney, providing favorable facts about the defendant, and otherwise assisting in the defense.  In some cases, it is advisable for an alleged victim to retain her own attorney to advise about any issues with false statements to the police, about refusal to comply with a subpoena, and about other matters.  It is certainly possible for prosecutors to ""drop"" or dismiss a case where the alleged victim is uncooperative, but it also by no means automatic.  The best advice here would be to work with the defense attorney, and possibly even with the alleged victim's own attorney, to achieve the best outcome possible for all concerned.  General information in a public forum is no substitute for personal advice from an attorney familiar with the facts of a specific case."

1793941,"Dear asker,  No attorney will estimate your chance of success at obtaining non-marital assets in a divorce with a paragraph posted on a public forum.  It would be irresponsible to do so.   Your spouse is correct that child support is warranted since you share a child together, but making the case that you need his non-marital assets for support (especially in light of your higher earning potential and your medical degree) is going to be a hard case to prove.    You should also be aware that MDs and Attorneys in NY who divorce their spouses after medical school or law school have had part of the value of their licenses awarded to the other spouse as part of marital asset distribution in NY.  In other words, he might be able to claim that you owe HIM support for carrying you in medical school if that is what happened.  In EITHER case, whether he did or did not, you should sit down with a family law attorney for a full consultation on your options."
1824983,"Using your numbers, the indemnity portion has a potential value between 32K and roughly 90K.  So 70 isn't a bad number, but . . .  The problem is-your numbers may not be correct.  The compensation rate is based on a 52 week wage statement and those can be challenged as being incorrect.  The impairment is from their doctor and while it is substantial, your surgery was a very complicated one and higher impairments are potentially possible, and finally, there are caps and age limits applicable in your case that a seasoned worker's comp practitioner will understand.  Not selling the future medicals is a good idea-it has numerous pitfalls and the insurance company would not be trying to buy out that benefit unless it was financially to their advantage.  Get a Workers Compensation attorney to review the settlement and discuss this in person."
1797276,"So long as the kids remain eligible, they should be enrolled at the same school they have attended.  If mom tries to enroll them elsewhere, the file should be flagged and she should be advised the kids are already enrolled.  The burden would be on her to make a motion before the court to change schools.  She would have to prove the kids would be better off, not her.  The bureaucracy does not always work as it should, so you need to have their current school personnel let you know if they get a request for records."
1803621,"Unless the city signed a release accepting the negotiated restitution as full payment, you are civilly liable for any damages that are not included in the restitution.

In short, in order to answer this question you need to be an experienced, accomplished family law lawyer!!   I would not hazard any guesses or engage in speculation about how this will come out.  I would not dare.  Way too much is at stake for guesses in this case.   You deserve a studied, researched and reasonable analysis based on all the evidence.

1819488,"First, ""fraud "" as defined by the bankruptcy code is a narrower concept than many state definitions as it requires a subjective intent normally also. But first, you must list the debts. Second, as long as you have valid addresses, then you sit and wait and see if an adversary case is filed. Third, if they do, at least you can discharge the other dischargeable debt, whatever it might be. At some point,  I would imagine the $3 Million in debt will be gone as a result of the statute of limitations or the expireration of the enforceability of judgments! Good luck.   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

1822407,"Obviously, the most important thing at this point is for your mother to get the right kind of medical care.  Her health is the priority.  She is lucky to have you helping her.  There may have been malpractice but not enough is known.  It will require an expert review by another doctor, who will review all of her medical records.  Once your mother has stabilized and her long-term health is better known, you should talk to a lawyer in your area who specializes in medical malpractice cases.  One thing you could do now is to have the home nurse write out what she has observed about your mother's condition when she has come to the home.  That way the nurse will have a record to reflect on in the future if she is called upon to testify or give a statement."
1293732,"If there is a warrant for your arrest, you would be smart to find out which judge is assigned to your case and appear.  When bail is set for such a low, low amount, it is likely that bail will be waived and you'll be simply ordered back to court on your own recognizance (OR).  If you paid back the amount stolen, a good attorney can ask for dismissal of the case based on a civil compromise under Penal Code section 1377 and 1378.  One requirement of such a motion is showing that the ""victim"" (your former employer) has been ""made whole"" (paid for the losses) and is no longer interested in prosecution.  The last element may be difficult to show, but a good attorney can speak to your former employer and perhaps, if unsuccessful, persuade the judge to exercise his discretion to give such a requirement little weight.  The special program that is referred to sounds like a form of diversion where you may ""earn a dismissal"" by taking a course about theft called a theft-prevention course.  However, it would be probably better for you if the case were simply dismissed and you did not have to hassle with such a class.  Find a good attorney who has experience in a motion for civil compromise.  Good luck."
1801912,"As a juvenile, he will most likely face adjudication proceedings in a juvenile court.  Sex offender registration requirements are a distinct possibility.  With the nature of such charges, you will need an attorney experienced in fighting both, sexual assault and juvenile proceedings.  By avoiding an adjudication, you may well preserve your child's future.  In addition to having to register, he could be required to attend sex offender counseling and or be required to stay away from other children.  I recommend that you advise your child to NOT TALK TO ANYONE about ANYTHING regarding this.  THAT INCLUDES POLICE, CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER PERSONNEL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, JUDGES, TEACHERS, etc.  He is ONLY to talk to his attorney about this and if anyone tries to interrogate him make sure he understands to tell them that he will not make any statement without his attorney and that he is exercising his right to an attorney.  You might also face child protective services intervention.  He quite possibly will face detention in a juvenile facility.  Get an attorney as quickly as possible.  If he is adjudicated, he may have to attend alternative education classes and no longer be eligible for sports teams and such.  Depending on any restrictions he may be placed under, he may have to be home schooled.  That is why it is so important that you not try to ""talk your way out of this"" or have him ""talk his way out of this"" as most likely it will impair his defense.  GET AN ATTORNEY pronto and DON'T make statements, talk about this or even try to call the girl or her family.  DO start trying to save social media posts (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc.).  Print them out/Save them to disk or other media for your attorney.    Good Luck"

If you did not agree to the divorce being filed in Jefferson County you could have filed a motion with the court objecting to the venue since neither of you lived in that county and I am *assuming* that you did not live in Jefferson County when you separated. If you did live there when you separated then it would be the proper venue since a divorce can be filed in either the county where you separated or the county where the other party now lives, if they live in Alabama. At this point it is too late to object to the venue, but I am somewhat confused as to why you feel as though you were ""cheated"" or ""screwed"" because the divorce was in Jefferson County and not Madison County. If it was an uncontested divorce, as it appears it was, then you agreed to all of the terms (including venue) when you signed the paperwork and I would assume the terms would have been the same whether it was filed in Jefferson or Madison County."

It is very unlikely that a simple denial would be enough to beat a speeding ticket and it is completely irrelevant whether you knew you were speeding or simply drove too fast by mistake.

That period is known as the period of obsolescence for a collection account.  If the debt is not a collection account, then a debt with derogatory history can only be reported for 7 years from date of the default.  If the credit reporting agency has the correct information from the furnisher, then the debt will no longer be reported after the period of obsolescence expires.  I have a sample letter, linked below, which is specifically to dispute a debt after the debt's period of obsolescence has expired. I suggest you use it, as instructed on my website, to dispute this reporting on your credit reports, after it should no longer be allowed on your credit report.  If the account was only opened in 2008, then it still has several years of reporting before it must be removed.

1825986,"Typically if they did not contact the police right then, they won't in the future. No, they haven't relinquished any criminal case. The prosecutor's office and not Nordstrom makes that decision in whether or not charges are filed. The most nordstroms could do is file a subsequent police report.   The toll free number they want you to call is to pay a civil demand. If you ignore their invitation to call, you'll likely get a few letters from them asking for hundreds of dollars. The loss prevention folks at the store may have said that you'd have to pay a ""fine.""    It's not a civil ""fine"" - it's a civil demand letter. California law allows a merchant to demand up to $500 following a theft incident. These letters are typically sent by the store or a law firm acting on their behalf. They are all bark and no bite.   If you ignore the letter, they have to make a choice - let it go or file a small claims case against you. I have never heard of anyone actually being sued if they ignore the letter. Why don't they do anything? Because lawyers cannot get involved in small claims cases and it isn't worth the store's time to pursue a small claims case over such a minor amount.   There is one law firm in Florida that does nothing but these kind of civil demand letters on behalf of stores. They were quoted in a Wall Street Journal article as sending out over one and a half million letters a year, but they filed less than 10 lawsuits. Not ten percent. Not ten thousand. Ten. The odds are overwhelming that they won't do anything.   If you choose to pay their demand, it just means they won't sue you, but it will have no impact on any criminal prosecution. Paying it won't stop criminal charges from being filed and not paying it won't make a criminal case worse or cause charges to be filed if they weren't going to be in the first place."

Proof would be found in those bills that you paid while living there that are in your name and, since you were living there in the landlord collected rent, he has a 2nd hurdle to overcome in demonstrating he was unaware of your presence.

Typically they get out of it because their hourly fees are $400 plus per hour and they have a 4 hour minimum plus document review time.  Most people can't afford that.  You may need to file a motion asking that the witness be allowed to appear by phone.  But first call the Court Coordinator and ask how your Court wants phone appearances handled.   It will make it hard to show him documents, so you want to arrange the exhibits in advance.  Another option is to take his deposition.  For doctors that is generally done in  their office.  Depositions can be very expensive depending upon their length.  You would get someone to read the relevant portions (questions and answers) at trial. Are you sure this isn't something that could be handled by filing the doctor's business records with the Court in accordance with Texas Rules of Evidence 902, 14 days before hearing or trial?"

Many and most warrants do not show up on any normal search.  Sometimes, the only way an attorney can find out is if she/he talks directly to the detective who got the warrant, if that is the case.   Once your attorney is able to find out what the warrant is for and the bond amount, then you need to call a reputable bondsman. Your attorney may know one for you.  You can workout the details of the bond and then have the bondsman go with you to the jail so you should only do a turnaround. Where you are booked then released.  Best of luck."

1815118,"You do want a lawyer with divorce expertise.   So you don't want someone who dabbles in it now and then.  Having said that, many divorce attorneys, myself included, do handle some other areas of law.  Nonetheless, probably around half my cases are divorce and domestic cases.  That is the type expertise that you should want and expect.  No attorney can be up on every area of law - that is why, for example, I don't do immigration, tax, patent and products liability cases.  But some areas of law are complimentary to family law (including wills and bankruptcy) and to provide good service to my clients, I cover those complementary fields.   Here is what I would ask a lawyer.  Find out what he charges (since you do have to be able to afford him).  Find out if he has done divorces for a long time as opposed to a couple years or less.   And be sure some of his practice is in the court you will be in."
1794374,Your Husband cannot modify a Court Order on his own.  Only the Court can modify the Order unless the two of you agree to a modification which still has to be approved by the Court.  If you have an attorney call them and see about a contempt petition.  If you do not have an attorney you can file a contempt action on your own but it is best to have an attorney to make sure all your rights are protected.  If you are unsure how to find a good attorney you should go to the local legal aid and they can provide you with the names of a few attorneys for you to call for a consultation.
1828639,"You need to contact the IRS office that is managing your installment payment plan for 2012 to discuss the problem with them and to see if you can get yourself into a new installment plan that includes both the 2012 and 2013 taxes.  One of the reasons for this is that the unpaid 2013 taxes will most likely be treated as a violation of your installment plan for the 2012 taxes, which means that the IRS could resort to enforced collection again - like levying on your bank accounts - if you don't take steps to get into a new installment plan.  Not dealing with it now and just trying to fly under the radar and keep doing what you've been doing before is not a good idea; it's definitely a bad idea when it comes to the IRS and unpaid taxes.  If you had an attorney help you set up the first plan, I would suggest you contact that attorney to get the 2013 problem taken care of as well.  If you didn't have an attorney, I would strongly urge you to consult at least briefly with a competent tax attorney or CPA in your area to get a better sense of the likelihood that you'll be able to get a new payment plan without too much trouble."
1795038,"You are right to be concerned about the Statue of Limitations which restrict the time frame in which a lawsuit must be filed.

1829800,"I too am sorry to hear of your grandmother's condition.  The above advice is all correct--but just to sort of consolidate it a little: 1.  Yes, it is too late for her to sign a power of attorney as she must be of sound mind. 2.  As Mr. Luthmann said, the solution is to seek legal permission to be her guardian.  Mr. Bianchi's suggestion to contact the Senior & Long Term Care office would be a good place to start--at least to learn more about what the Guardianship proceeding is and the proper steps you need to take.   3.  Other sources to find attorneys who may be able to help:  use the ""Find a Lawyer"" and search for NY attorneys in the Guardianship practice area (as well as Elder Law area) or seek out a legal services organization who may help connect you to an attorney willing to do the work for little or no cost. 4.  Just a few points about the process:  after you file a petition the court will assign a hearing date and ask you to notify all other close family members about your intent (e.g., any living children of your grandmother (your aunts & uncles), any other grandchildren, and any living brothers or sisters of your grandmother) about the hearing (so they may have an opportunity to contest your request).  The court will also appoint a ""Court Examiner"" who will conduct independent research about your grandmother's condition and render an opinion to the court to be considered at the hearing.  In some cases, the court will appoint an attorney to represent your grandmother.  You will need to provide ""clear and convincing evidence"" about your grandmother's lack of capabilities to care for herself.  Also--providing she is able, your grandmother is also expected to attend the hearing to speak on her own behalf about whether she wants a guardian.      Fortunately, the fees are low to submit the petition to the court ($20) and, if your grandmother is unable to afford an attorney, the court will appoint one for her (if required) at no charge.

1805050,"Assuming that the divorce judgment does indeed award a portion of your pension to your ex wife, then you can do two things (I listed them in random order, but it may be easier to start with #2 and if you don't get any information then do #1).   1. Get your divorce file in the court (AZ) and see what QDROs if any were filed. There should be one QDRO for the 401(k) Plan and another one for the pension. I highly doubt that even if the same employer sponsors both the 401(k) and the pension that a single QDRO would be allowed for both plans. Each plan needs its own QDRO. That is how it is usually done.   2. You can call the plan administrator of the pension plan. As a participant you have a right to receive information. Ask them if there was a QDRO filed with respect to your benefits under that pension plan.  Even if the pension plan administrator tells you that there is no QDRO on your ""file"" with the plan, that does not mean that a QDRO was not filed in court. It may happen that a QDRO was filed in court but then it was never submitted to the plan administrator for approval. It happens sometimes when somebody drops the ball with the QDRO process.

1803989,"Did you put the decimal in the wrong place? NOONE files for less than at least $5000 and some attorneys say $10,000. If in fact higher then other issues exist.   You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.  If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.  But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!   Your exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!   Some secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.   But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.   Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.   You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later"

It is something you *could* do on your own, but depending on the terms of the trust and other factors, it might be easier if you had a lawyer to assist you. There is no pre-printed form for what you want to do. You would need to draw up a petition and ask the judge to intervene. In my view, the outcome will hinge on what latitude the trust gives the trustee, in terms of liquidating and distributing assets to the beneficiaries.  James Frederick"

1609403,"When a credit card company (or debt buyer) gets a judgment against you, they are allowed to do what is called ""post-judgment discovery.""  Basically, this means that they can ask you questions to help them locate your assets so that, when permitted, they can take and liquidate the assets to get paid on the judgment.  What shows on your credit report is not determinative.  ""Charged Off"" just means that you defaulted on the credit card account and remained defaulted for 6 months.  In fact, the account has to be charged off before they can file a lawsuit against you on the debt.  In Texas, judgments CAN be renewed indefinitely.  Judgments are valid for 10 years, and can be renewed for another 10 years after that and then another 10 years after that and so on.  And the judgment can remain on your credit report for as long as it is ""active,"" i.e., not expired.  You can still settle the judgments for reduced amounts.  Or, you could file bankruptcy, if you are eligible based on your income and assets, and discharge the judgments.  We can help you with either one of these things.  We have offices throughout Texas, including San Antonio.   Hope this helps."

Don't be tempted by ""but they won't know"" - they may not at the time - but it might be obvious when it comes to an interview for your resident benefit. It might be worth a conversation with an attorney to see if you had more than LPR status as a child but don't know it. If your bf is resident here, then he can petition for you with an I-129f fiancÌ© visa. When his side of the work is done, you then have an interview at the embassy, and then are given 90 days to come get comfortable and get married - after which time you adjust status. If you have established residence in the UK, your interview will probably be in London, otherwise back in Canada. Your question hints that maybe you want more than a 90 day window - so you are sure you want to get married - and if so, and you have a degree and work in an in-demand field - you could always come to the US on a work visa where they allow ""dual-intent"" (the intent to immigrate as well as the other reason for the visa).

I think the four factor test under 17 USC 107 leans your way, particularly the key fourth factor, namely any adverse effect of your use on the market for the game. I would think your use would increase the market for the game not decrease it.  The devil is in the details on this. How many screenshots you use and for what purpose and whether you really need screenshots or whether you could serve your purpose without having to use actual screenshots. In order to get a better feel for this need to consult an intellectual property law attorney, preferably one from here in the St. Louis area where you are located, as this question is a close legal question that cannot really be answered in the abstract."

If they are still in your mother's name, you may have to get them transferred into your trust's name. If that can be done by simply registering them as copyright material I would do that. If title has to be transferred by the Court you have a probate issue. I would talk with an attorney about this as soon as you have the opportunity."

1796863,"I would file the Proof of claim for all NOW. Attach proof of all parts.   Then, you can still proceed if you desire in civil court. But why? First, the stay of filing bankruptcy does not stop a filing by you in civil court for the establishment or modification of child support. If the court ordered bills are deemed to be ""child support"" which they likely are, then you can file anytime.   Secondly, why spend the money to go to court now? If you file your proof of claim for all, and list all as priority, then  they may get paid in full in the bankruptcy case. If paid in full, why waste time and possibly attorney fees to file the same in civil court when the same debt can be paid in full in the bankruptcy court. ? I see no reason. The act of obtaining a judgment does not change the ""priority"" of the other debts owed into anything new....they will still be a priority. ! Good luck and great question."

Second, you could file for a civilian warrant application for forgery against your ex-wife.  Third, if you entered into a settlement agreement in your divorce, there should be some language regarding use of the other's credit and disclosure of current debts at the time of signing.  If there is, you could file a contempt action against her in superior court.  It may be worth speaking with an attorney who can assist you with whichever route you feel is best for your situation."

2331950,"I agree with the others who have advised you to have your daughter consult with an experienced  probate attorney in the greater Metro-Phoenix area (Maricopa County), preferably when offices will re-open after the Labor Day Weekend. The conduct of your grandson's father should not make you lose sight of your objective--to get competent legal counsel for both your daughter to preserve her rights and, somewhat separately, the best representation for your grandson. A court will be appointing someone to be probably both a legal guardian/representative, as well as a conservator, for your grandson. Your daughter will have to decide whether she is content to have the young man's father appointed by the court, or whether she wishes to seek to be appointed herself, and thereby oppose the likely attempt by the father to be so appointed. Essentially neither will be compensated for their role if appointed by the court, and neither would have access to use any money that may be recovered other than as ordered by the court. A third option, depending on the circumstances, would be for the court to appoint an officer of the trust division of a local bank to act as conservator of any funds recovered on your grandson's behalf.  The entire matter is complicated further by the potential likelihood of your grandson requiring long-term (possibly lifetime) governmental benefits, the value of which could dwarf any potential insurance recovery for his personal injury claim or claims. NO ONE should enter into ANY settlement agreements, arising out of the motorcycle crash, without first evaluating the impact such settlement(s) may have on your grandson's financial qualification for future governmental benefits. I know of a number of well-qualified probate attorneys (I am not one of those), should you care for referrals. I am located in Chandler, Arizona--within Maricopa County. I hope for the best possible lifetime outcome for your grandson, but also for the emotional fortitude, dispassionate action and spirit of cooperation necessary for ALL of your grandson's loved ones, who each in his or her own way are filled with grief, fear and concern at this very stress filled time!"

During appeal process, you may remain in the U.S. However, once the appeal decision is made, it will determine whether our stay was legal or illegal during the time you were waiting for the answer. If appeal is denied, then the entire time will be considered as overstay of visa. If your appeal is successful, then you would be considered legal for the period you waited for the decision. In any case, if OPT would be valid until Oct you should consider whether it is worth risking an overstay for a month worth of OPT, if any at all. Talk to an attorney in private to explore all your options. You may be dangerously close to getting a bar on your admissibility. Do not delay any longer."
1816928,"Possibly. You should have your vet or another reputable breeder examine the dog and document in writing that it is NOT a purebred and that they are certain of that. Then, I would take copies of the documentation, along with a copy of the contract, to the breeder that you purchased from to see if they will cut you a break on the price. Oftentimes it is difficult to be positive though. We had a Newfie that definitely looked fully like a Newfie. However, our purebred Great Pyrenees looks a little more yellow lab in the face and our previous St. Bernard looked nothing like a St. Bernard until we cured her of her ring worm. So, you really need to be certain. Just like people, purebreds can vary greatly."

Often these cases are settled with a ""covenant not to execute"" meaning you would not be personally liable for a judgment.  The adverse party is likely proceeding under his own policy with an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim.  The way this works in South Carolina is that you would still be named in a lawsuit (as the jury is not told about insurance) and the UIM lawyer here is contacting you for cooperation.  This is based on your question, and what I read into it."

1828936,"I think everyone has provided really good answers. It's rare that you see one question be answered to many times. I would start by asking a title company what they need to insure title to a third party buyer. Whatever they say, you will want to hire an attorney to do. The attorney would either be probate or real estate (or either) depending on the nature of what the title company wants.  The reason I advise this is because title passes at the time of death. Assuming you are the true and single owner, then you already own the property. You just need to make a third party buyer comfortable. Since the third party buyer will almost certainly use title insurance to make himself comfortable, you really just need to satisfy the title company."
1810849,"Dear asker,  What you have presented is a vague, unsubstantiated list of nonspecific complaints.  In order for you to determine whether you have a current claim for any legal harms or any ongoing legal harms, you need to organize your statements for an attorney, and make clear what has happened from A-Z.  That is NOT the type of thing we would be able to provide for you in an online forum.  I suggest that you make an appointment with a personal injury attorney, and that when you show up at the attorney's office, you have the following pieces of information ready: 1.  A chronological list of what happened and when it happened; 2.  A list of all of the accounts affected by the alleged identity theft. 3.  A list of all bank transactions or credit card transactions that you attribute to false charges 4.  A list of the dates and times of all medical/psychological treatments related to the alleged legal harms 5.  Any records regarding restraining orders, orders of protection, domestic violence charges, etc.  Once you have organized these items in a clear, and coherent fashion, then an attorney might be able to review your claims with you."

1823635,"In every county in which I have represented foreclosure defendants at settlement conferences held pursuant to CPLR 3408, I have found that cases are released from the part and allowed to proceed to motions once a loan modification is no longer being pursued. While I agree that this does not comport with the language of the CPLR, the courts have consistently maintained that the purpose of the conferences is to help preserve home ownership through modifications- as a short sale also results in the borrower losing the home, the court does not feel it is an adequate reason to delay a foreclosure. However, I have often found that if a potential short sale has advanced to contract, and is awaiting approval from the Plaintiff bank, a judge will usually stay any sale at auction of the subject premises pending a determination on the pending short sale application."
1792578,"I agree with Mr. Harkess that you post rambles.

877514,"First, I am terribly sorry for your loss.  Although an autopsy does help in some cases, it is not the end all.  The key is making that link, that causal connection between the neglect and the cause of death. If the death certificate gives a reason or cause of death and is directly linked to the neglect, most of the work is already done, thus an autopsy would only bolster an already perfect storm.  In the scenario you have presented, there is not enough information get a clear understanding of the facts, to give quality personalized advice, however an autopsy is usually needed to rule out other causes of death that the defense may want to use to cast doubt in the mind of the jury.  If the cause of death is known to be a result of the fall and the fall can be linked to neglect rather than an unfortunate, unavoidable accident, then it is far from a disaster to not have one.  There are many wrongful deaths cases we have been involved with and have been successful proving, without autopsy's.  A good quality medical expert will be bale to make the connection Also, you did not mention when this happened so you need to be mindful of the statute of limitations on wrongful death cases in Maryland.  if there is one."

Also, keep in mind, they won't dismiss the charges just because you ask them to.  Get a lawyer as soon as possible."
1811104,"I realize it sounds unfair, but the law allows the plan to go after retirees to recover overpayments. The plan trustees actually have a fiduciary duty to try to recover overpayments and that is why they are asking for the repayment. However, it is common in these situations that if you follow the appeals process indicated in the letter you received about the overpayment, and you prove that you have financial hardship to pay that amount back, the plan will forgive the repayment.   It's just that the plan is caught in between fulfilling their fiduciary duties to correct the mistake and to try to not cause undue hardship to the participants by asking them to repay the overpayment. In the end it will come down to how well you can prove to the plan that it is pretty much impossible for you to pay. If you cannot prove that, it will be hard for the plan to find a reasonable basis to forgive the overpayment.   Good luck.

1816039,"I agree with Mr. Early - the witnesses normally would have just signed the document at the same time you signed it, since they have to see you sign and you are supposed to see them sign, too. It's not clear to me from your post whether your Will is even validly executed. There may be some innocent reason behind them retaining the Will (to make a copy for their files, for example), but it doesn't make much sense for them to do so to obtain witness signatures on anything.  If you haven't already followed up with the attorney who prepared the Will, you should do so and inquire as to the status of the Will. If they don't give you the Will, then yes, you may want to hire another lawyer. I'd even recommend two lawyers, perhaps: one to get you a properly-executed Will prepared and another to pursue a refund of any fees you paid. Even if you get the Will, I might have someone else look at it just to see whether it appears to actually be valid."

1801148,"No, it is not correct.  You are entitled to receive overtime any time you work more than 8 hours in any defined workday, or more than 40 hours in any defined workweek.    A word of warning.  If you were to file a lawsuit in superior court today to get overtime earned and not paid, you would only be able to go back 4 years from today.  In other words, every day you delay in filing a lawsuit is costing you overtime pay you would have been entitled to receive but which should have been paid more than four years before the date of filing.  You therefore need to move quickly.  You are losing money every day.  Please note that the only way you can even go back four years is if you file a superior court lawsuit and allege the failure to pay was an unfair business practice.  Otherwise, if you file an administrative complaint with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, also known as the Labor Commissioner's Office, you can only go back three years.  An employer violating this law is likely violating other Labor Code provisions.  You may be losing more money that you know.  Locate and consult with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible to explore your facts and determine your options.  I would suggest you look either on this site in the Find a Lawyer section, or go to www.cela.org, the home page for the California Employment Lawyers Association, an organization whose members are dedicated to the representation of employees against their employers.  Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you. Many advance all the costs of the litigation as well. Do not let fear of fees and costs keep you from finding a good attorney.  Good luck to you."
1800568,"There was a similar question answered today. You might find it helpful. The issue is whether you work in the United States when you are not authorized to.  If you receive royalties for work done outside of the US, and absolutely no work was done here while you were an F-1 - even to manage the business - then it is hard to see how you might be ""working"" in the US. You are financing your studies through funds from outside the country. Otherwise, no author could come to the US for a long holiday. If it were me, I would make sure that there is clear evidence of all the music release work you do back in your home country, to account for every new track that you sell. As you describe it, it does not smell iffy to me. But you might want to have an agent in your home country handle all emails and transactions from your distributor.

If you qualify, e.g. if one of your parents became a US citizen with you still under 18, then you are automatically deemed a US citizen and that's why you are filing the N-600 Instead of bothering with filing an I-90 to extend your green card (which might be even denied after collection of the fee, on grounds that you USCIS may already know you are a USC), it is a US passport you should be applying for.  Take all the documentary proof you submitted when filing the N-600 to the passport office: if you qualify for the N-600, the passport office will issue you a US passport much, much faster than your N-600 interview will be scheduled & you'll have the thrill of going to your N-600 interview with a US passport on hand!"

If the money is already yours then there is no tax simply for bringing the money into the country.  In fact, if you're moving here to live here permanently, it would be a good idea to move your money to a bank in the US and close your overseas accounts because that way you won't have to file the annual Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBARs) to report your foreign account balances to the IRS.

1819458,"So many people find themselves in this predicament. Accept the poor service for the duration of the agreement or terminate early and eat the fees...neither is a good option, and realistically, they're often your only options, unless of course you count the provider's inevitable offer to upgrade your service at a reduced monthly fee. The catch with the latter is that those offers almost always entail a new 2 year agreement and the reduced rate is rarely locked in for more than a few months, at the end of which you suddenly find yourself in this same position; because like the first agreement, the new agreement contains a provision enabling the service provider to change the rates without prior notice to you, the consumer.   So, assuming you are not in fact interested in changing your plan and extending your service term, we're back to options 1 and 2 above. Troubleshooting your way through the next 6+ months of shoddy internet service doesn't sound too pleasant, so alas we arrive at your original question: can you terminate service? Short answer is yes, of course you can. BUT, they are going to charge you for it. Pursuant to your agreement, the amount of the termination fee likely depends on the number of months left on your agreement.   Termination fees can be high, VERY HIGH,  particularly with satellite service providers, so the first thing you will want to do is find out how much that fee is going to be. If it's an amount you can find it within yourself to stomach, go ahead and pay it and be done with it. You may be out a few hundred dollars but it may be well worth the money to have avoided the headaches you will encounter trying to battle for a reduction in, or release from, the early termination fee.   Now, should sheer principal or the balance in your checking account require that you fight the fee, there is one approach that might be of use and several tips that can help you along the way. First, a sometimes successful approach: if they want to enforce the early termination terms of the agreement, they, in theory, are going to need to be able to produce the agreement. This often overlooked principal of contracts proves difficult for many a service provider.  Can they show you the document you signed agreeing to a 2 year service contract? It will probably take them 7-10 business days to find out, and if it turns out that they can't produce it, well, now you're in a much better position to contest that ""early termination fee."" That's one approach you can start with. Now, the tips: 1) If you are going to try and fight the fee, go ahead and see if your provider allows you to freeze or pause your account for a period. If so, you can go ahead and pause service such that you do not have to pay a monthly bill while you battle it out with them. The paused period will not count towards your 2 years, but if you're ultimately successful with the approach discussed above, you'll have saved yourself the money you would have paid for a couple of months of service you didn't want, and the lost time credit won't matter.  2) If you authorized automatic payments, go back and remove that authorization or you will continue to be charged regardless of your grievance status. 3) Document EVERYTHING, write down the date and time of each conversation you have with the provider (there will likely be many), the name of the representative you spoke to, their company id number, and their direct line. These things are important as those handy little ""notes"" they make concerning your conversations have a funny way of disappearing from the system before you get back to them about the copy of the contract that still hasn't arrived. 4) Ask for everything in writing and request confirmation emails for any action taken on your account. 5) In the event you terminate before working something out, know that rather than bill you, they are going to auto-draft the termination fee from your checking account. Best of luck!"

If the reference is not so clear, your parents can add a Codicil to their Wills or Amend their Trusts to change your name.

1786112,"Start by speaking to a civil attorney who specializes in sexual molestation claims against police officers or at least has experience in this.

The civil attorney may be able to help you get such a waiver.  It is not easy this late in the game.  That is the starting point.  The government then must respond to your claim.  They can reject it (most likely) or seek to resolve it.  If they reject it, you can then file a lawsuit and then again, you will have statute of limitations issues that a good civil attorney may be able to help you with.  Good luck."

1807048,You have the right to file a Reply Brief.  Make sure it is filed at least 5 COURT days before the hearing date per the Code of Civil Procedure.  You can just do a declaration and call it a Reply which is not to exceed 5 pages.  You do not need the FL-320 for the Reply.
1794260,It means the insurance carrier owes you temporary disability benefits from the date on the order to present. The continuing part means that they will owe you temporary disability until they file a Petition to Terminate and a Workers Compensation Judge orders temporary disability ended.  This will be based on a doctor's report finding you Permanent and Stationary or until you return to work.
1818801,"Are you asking about attorney's fees or court filing fees?  If you have already filed an appearance in the lawsuit and paid the court fee for appearing, the only other court costs would be a motion fee to vacate the stay in execution on the judgment (assuming that the judgment contained a stay) and a fee to levy on the house.  If the debtors are living in it, you might need to pay them the amount of the homestead exemption.  And you would need to pay an appraiser.  As to attorney's fees, without seeing the documents and knowing the specifics, I could only guess.  Even if I knew more, I could still only guess.    I hope that you recorded an Abstract of Judgment in the county where the house is located."
1823396,"Messy.  This one is going to get very expensive too.  I would suggest that you use the new Supreme Court Rule 13, that allows a lawyer do draft everything and coach you through it all.  That way, you can still represent yourself, but have a lawyer in your back pocket - so to speak.  The lawyer will have their appearance on file too with the Court, so your husband (and or his lawyer) will have to give the lawyer motions and other notices.  It's a perfect fit here, and the trick is just trying to find a lawyer willing to take on a Rule 13 type of case.  Many lawyers don't like doing it that way - but keep on looking and interviewing lawyers.   The other lawyers that answered all have good advice too.  You're doing the right thing by researching.  All my best, Paul"
1821569,"This is neither a ""criminal defense"" question nor is it a matter of ""criminal defense"".  This is a matter of KS educational requirements, which you can probably determine online by looking at their website (for your convenience a link follows - please see:  http://www.ksde.org/ ).  If your answers are not apparent online then  their contact information is and I suggest that you call and ask them directly over the phone.  That said, the mere fact that you think that this is a ""criminal defense"" question absolutely and unequivocally convinces me that you should not only NOT drop out of school but that you should double down and work your tail off to improve your grades.  I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."
1796216,"I would guess not, unless you have a very unusual lease. One purpose of that deposit is to make sure that your landlord has money to pay for repairs and cleaning of the property should you leave it in an unacceptable condition. The flip side of that, of course, is that it's me unknown for money to be kept because of things that either aren't the tenant's responsibility or weren't really wrong at all. If you're concerned this may happen, a better approach might be to schedule a walk-through inspection of the property before you leave, so that the two of you can discuss any potential problems while you have the opportunity to see them for yourself, and also taking lots of detailed photos of the property just before you move out, in case something does become an issue. Good luck."
2727590,"This is one of the worst things I have ever read on avvo.com. If you are looking for an attorney, then use the ""find a lawyer"" tab on this site. I would also recommend Butch Wagner of Wagner & Jones or Rex Perris. Both have offices somewhat near you. Best of luck."
1823827,"You have at least 2 issues here; 1.  Getting a ""plain language"" transcript of account, and 2. having the trustee properly inform you of the facts.  As for # 1, as a beneficiary you are entitled to obtain such information directly from the Franchise Tax Board upon provision of evidence establishing you are a beneficiary of the trust.  You should be able to get information on how to do so at the FTB website ftb.ca.gov  .    As for # 2, that is a New York law issue which I am not qualified to answer, but in California you could force the issue in court."
1825247,"Court will not order a private judge.  You can offer settlement negotiations and make the offer in writing of using a private judge.  Then offer this as evidence to the judge as to the other sides refusal to bring this to resolution and possibly ask for sanctions.  But, one the trial has started, then basically you are locked into that mode of resolution.  If you need to just get your status done, then file a motion for status only."
1791090,"You have done everything that you could. If you have homeowners insurance, contact them and let them know what happened. If you do not have homeowners insurance, you can either wait and see if they bring a lawsuit or contact a private attorney now. Sometimes when the injured party learns that you do not have insurance or collectable assets, they will not bring a lawsuit."
1797804,"It is not an invasion of his privacy. In fact, the court will want to review all sources of his income in order to determine child support.  I suggest you consult with an experienced family law attorney with regards to this matter immediately."
1823408,"I agree with the approaches of both Ms. Rohr and Mr. Nguyen, and would additionally add that you should issue a limited warranty for every product sold (product liability insurance coverage is a separate product that you should obtain).  All of these suggestions sound complicated, sound expensive, but...agreeing again with Ms. Rohr, they aren't.  Your daughter is to be commended for her entrepreneurial interests, and since my own 14-year old is also ""in business,"" I understand the need to keep it cheap until some sales roll in.  A good limited warranty would specifically disclaim fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and must be very carefully drafted.  It would limit recovery of any kind to just a refund.  This really should be drafted by an attorney.  I always caution folks against drafting their own legal documents, because as a litigator, I see the fall-out.  So the question is...will she make enough of a profit to justify an attorney's time for an hour?  Budget $250 to $300 for that, if you think her business is really going to be a winner."
1809975,Removal can be fairly quick relatively speaking.  Have him hire a skilled immigration attorney
1821413,Generally a court would not modify custody just based on an alternate lifestyle much less do so on an emergency basis. There must have been another reason that the court felt the kids were in danger and modified custody.
1998880,"You are not required to to attend AA.  The Administrative rules says a petitioner may present evidence of a structured support program such as a 12 step program like AA.  That being said the hearing officers love AA because they know what it entails.  They can interrogate or in the case of a review see details that support sobriety.  Hearing officers do not typically do background searches on witnesses, particularly out of state.   I would not worry about this..  They can call witnesses.  This is why the rules require a daytime phone number with community proof letters.  The issue is not your sponsors sobriety but yours.  Relapse is often a part of recovery, you must consider getting a new sponsor for your own sobriety.  Remember this is an under oath statement credibility is not only important it would be a criminal violation to not be straightforward.   Finally, if this is your third attempt it is safe to say you need expert help at this point.  You could have had your license by now, with a lawyer.  There is so much more to this and we help out of state drivers all the time.   Fees for lawyers in this area start as low as $500, at least at my office and a we have successfully represented clients in this practice area for twenty plus years.  Your obviously missing an important part of the puzzle.  Also the review does not have to be the final word you can appeal a hearing officers decision to the circuit court."
2078506,You could benefit from meeting with an attorney to discuss further. Even if you decide not to hire the attorney the consultation with him or her could help you to understand the issues and your options. Many attorneys offer a free consultation. I wish you the best.

1820457,"Absolutely not.  Your brother will only have rights to what is given him in her will.  Now her will must be legally authorized and binding, so go to a lawyer to make sure it's a good legal will.  You do need to watch out for possible claims of undue influence by your brother against you while challenging the will in probate, but unless he has lots of money and you've fouled up the will process, your mother's wishes should be the final say on the matter.  Again, I stress taking the matter to an experienced Alabama lawyer."
1822456,"The only advice I have is to avoid ""if that works"" - make your life plans, and be able to discuss the pros and cons of each option, and you are not together yet because you haven't made the final decision on who goes and who stays.  Take your son with you to the interview and make sure he sits on your husband's lap. He is the best attorney you can hire for the interview. If the two of you are going to be together for more than just the interview day, a ""rehearsal"" interview with an attorney is good value - and you can get a reality check on what you say. I hope it goes well."
1789416,"A DUI conviction is considered a major violation for CDL purposes. 2 major violations after January 1, 2008 will result in a lifetime CDL disqualification. If your DUI convictions were prior to January 1, 2008 then you may not be facing a lifetime disqualification."

Also, note that USCIS must resolve your request for the EAD in 90 days; if the second FORM I-765 is not adjudicated in 90 days your work authorization is automatically extended for 240 days while the FORM I-485 remains pending."
1792570,"What they are doing in Montgomery County 99% of the time for these now is not IPSA contrary to what Mr. Welch has said.  It will be fine, stay in touch with your public defender.  You will have the option of doing IPSA possibly but there is another way to avoid IPSA, have the criminal charge dropped and pay a small fine which is considered a civil penalty not a criminal conviction.  Thus this would have no effect on employment etc in the future.  If the PD says anything else to you, get an informed local attorney and they can help you instead and pay for it, it will save you alot of money and time and trouble"
1828696,"Yes, during the validity of that green card unless they also served you with the NTA."
1805743,"You need to check the court docket very carefully to see if a reaffirmation agreement was filed. If the court is not convenient you can create a PACER account to look up case on line. Google ""Pacer"" for US federal courts look for account registration . No sign up charges and only .10 per page to print. If no reaffirmation agreement then no personal liability."
1806077,"It's hard to conceive how experts can opine without studying the material documents in the case. Did you compensate them for the time to do that? Had you provided the documents to them? Did you make it clear before their depositions that your ""experts"" were entitled to review any documents that they thought necessary to opine on the matter? Depending on where you stand in relation to the discovery deadline and trial, my suggestion would be to retain the services of another expert and withdraw the current ones. The people that you have sound inexperienced and unreliable. Are you pro se in this matter? If you are, get experienced counsel. What has happened here is a big time problem and you are not going to come out of it unscathed. It may be hard enough with counsel."
1803339,"Yes, you are correct. He will not get a discharge of debts arising from the dissolution proceeding in a chapter 7. You don't need to do anything pro-actively for a 523(a)(15) non-dischargeability determination. You can proceed with collection against him once the automatic stay has terminated.  You can either move the BK court to terminate the stay as to you or wait for the entry of his discharge which will terminate the stay automatically. It is frustrating, but I wish you luck collecting what is owed to you!"
1809126,"You can settle if they are willing.  The real question is, are they willing?  Most collection lawyers think they have you over the barrel.  However, as another lawyer said, they still have to prove the case.  In reality, that can be hard if you put up a real fight.    Collection laws are complicated and they get confusing in a hurry. You should consider talking to a consumer protection attorney. I suggest going to http://www.naca.net/find-attorney and find an attorney in your area who handles FDCPA, FCRA, or cases involving Credit Cards. Considering the fact that most consumer protection statutes pay for your attorney's fees, there is no reason to have to muddle through this on your own. Depending on the circumstances, many will take your case at no charge."
1810759,"I would suggest you consult with an attorney to fully discuss your situation. However, the short answer is that an eviction is not likely to occur in 7 days. As long as you are paying rent per the agreement an eviction will be difficult anyway without some other violation that warrants one. If the agreement you have requires 45 days notice as you say the landlord has to abide by the terms of the agreement, just as you do."
1828566,"I strongly differ with the other two attorneys. Harnessing and bullying is against the peaceful and tranquil atmosphere of a job. They may not be actionable in law on the face of it, but re portable to the Human Resources, if any. Does he use profanity? Does he use ethnic innuendos, or name calling by national origin? It is definitely against the law to bully and abusive the elderly consumers. A consumer complaint can be launched with the Better Business Bureau as well as the department of consumer affairs on your place. Also, let the HR people know. I am sure no business tolerate such behavior. His 11.5 years of service does not mean much and make it tolerable."
1798665,"If you walked away from the job, or if you told your employer that you no longer were going to work there, you quit.  If you did neither, and the employer stopped scheduling you to work, or told you that you were fired, you were terminated.  There are situations in some areas of employment law, where you can quit and it would still be considered a termination.  Constructive discharge is where the employee quit under such conditions that no reasonable employee could tolerate them.    Your former employer has no duty to inform you if you quit or were fired.  However, it can tell you how it has recorded your departure if it wishes to do so.  A sure fire way to get a position out of your employer is to file for unemployment benefits.  The employer will likely take a position after you apply, and you will know if the employer believes you voluntarily quit or were terminated.  Good luck to you."
1826315,"You are not required to respond to the defendant's answers, even amended answers."
1817733,"Nothing wrong with such provisions per se.  Any addendum will require additional consideration as would any contract or modification, and there may be issues as to what or how much evidence is adequate to trigger forfeiture but that goes to the content of the provisions rather than its enforceability per se.  I doubt a court would allow an automatic complete forfeiture without proof of the amount of actual damages and a clause such as ""evidence of smoking will result..."" is poor draftsmanship in my opinion.  Smoking is either allowed or it is not and any attempt by you to penalize a tenant for doing so will presumably require evidence but it is the smoking that triggers the penalty, not the procurement of evidence.  You should, of course, just incorporate all this into the original lease you have new tenants sign.  Good luck.  Greg Abbott  Consumer Law Northwest  6635 N.

1789452,"The legal standard you would have to prove is manifest injustice and It is extremely difficult to do so. However, if you can convince the Court that your attorney tricked you into changing your plea that would probably qualify as manifest injustice."
1806307,"A motion to set aside a judgment must be brought within three years of the entry of the judgment complained of; a judgment void for lack of personal or subject-matter jurisdiction may be attacked at any time.   The Supreme Court has expressly limited judgments  void on their face under subsection (a) to ""those judgments which lack either personal or subject matter jurisdiction.""  If you were not properly served, then the Court would not have personal jurisdiction over you, unless you made a general appearance by showing up in Court and litigating the case, for example.   You need to bring the Court documents you have (pleadings, Orders) to a family lawyer."
1817042,"I agree with counsel that you need to be proactive in this matter. Making noise causes a response and what you need is a response. Write a letter to one of the consumer advocates at the LA Times, write to services such as trip advisor and ask them what to do when BA loses your luggage. You may try suing in small claims court. I would also contact local news stations. If you paid for your tickets with a credit card, the credit card company may be able to help you .On the pricier side of the scale you could hire a lawyer and he may or may not be able to get them to move faster"
1813738,It sounds like the case was closed? If that's the case call your attorney and ask what the disposition was. If you were unrepresented you could also call the clerk's office.

1814512,"I believe your question has been thoroughly answered very well by the responding attorneys;, however, there is one more factor that should be considered.  I know Attorney Patrick Mahaney very well and hold great respect (and agree) in  his opinion, but there is an added element that should be considered when deciding on whether or not to use a public defender.  Generally, the public defender has a very good relationship with the prosecutor and the Judge simply because they spend so much time together in the courtroom.  A public defender will know how the Judge thinks and feels about various offenses or defendant's criminal records (repeat offenders).  I have been a public defender and now primarily handle cases where I have been privately retained.  I would say use your instinct and gut feelings concerning the demeanor exhibited by the attorney when discussing the case.  Is he/she listening, making eye contact,  communicating with you in a genuine attentive state regarding your specific case.  If you get a ""comfortable feeling"" about the attorney, he or she will most likely be able to achieve an optimal outcome for you or your family member using his ability and relationships in that particular court.  During my nearly 20 years of practice, I have many times convinced perspective clients to stay with their appointed lawyer rather than take a fee, if I knew that appointed lawyer to be competent and effective in the courtroom.  I hope this helps.  If you aren't comfortable or feel ""too rushed"", by all means hire an attorney that you have confidence in.  Trey Norman Trey@treynorman.com"
1810338,"I agree there is no requirement to wait before filing with the Court. Whenever a fiduciary is involved, especially in a case like this involving large amount of cash, you should ensure the fiduciary is sufficiently bonded and insured so that there may be protection in the event there is a loss caused by the fiduciary. I would advise that you ask for proof of current bond and insurance, and if this fiduciary does not have it, I would consider changing to a fiduciary that is bonded and insured."
1829466,"You ask an interesting, but complicated and fact intensive question.  Your project may qualify as a ""transformative use."" Your project may qualify as a ""parody."" Your project may qualify as a ""commentary."" However, there are not enough facts presented to allow a determination to be made.   The problem with most of the situations where you use someone else's work and create a derivative work is that the copyright infringement determinations are almost always ""close calls"" and very subjective. So, the question to ask yourself is whether or not you are willing to take a chance and spend the time/money/energy necessary to create and sell your video, knowing that you could be sued for copyright infringement?  While your use may qualify as ""fair use"" you probably won't know until you get to litigate as a defendant in federal court.  I've included a link that you may find useful.  My recommendation is that you get with an attorney who understands copyright law, ""fair use,"" and ""transformative use"" prior to embarking on this project."

1813881,"There are many ways in which a decedent's family can learn about assets that were owned by the decedent.  One way is for an executor or administrator to request a copy of the person's most recent income tax return -- that will provide a wealth of information (although, in a spirit of full disclosure, I should tell you that the IRS is not usually terribly fast in providing the tax return).  If you know the name of the decedent's accountant, that should speed things up.  Other ways are pretty much common sense, such as going through the decedent's mail; most assets will leave ""traces"" every month or every quarter.   Most important, make sure that you retain an attorney experienced in estate matters.  Good luck to you."
1808328,"A key fact which you left out is whether or not the new agreement of 4 weeks in the summer, 2 weeks at a time, is in writing or just a verbal agreement.  It is easier to enforce a written agreement even if it has not been made into a court order.  Courts enforce written agreements all the time because Courts understand there is a need for great flexibility in custody and visitation matters.  Or perhaps you have a verbal agreement, but you have text messages and emails which specify the terms of this verbal agreement.  This would be another way to prove you have such an agreement.  In any event, file for a modification of custody or visitation, or both, present your evidence, and at court be ready to testify to the truth.  I highly recommend you consult with an attorney to make sure you do all of this the right way the first time, because you might only get one shot at this.  I recommend you not file for Contempt if there are no Court Orders that have been violated.  Although it is true that a Contempt action will get you in court together with the other party, if there are no Court Orders being violated here, this might make you look foolish, and could give the other party incentive to paint you in a very negative light.  On the other hand, if the other party is clearly violating a Court Order, then a Contempt of Court proceeding could be quite effective."

1814271,"Apparently, based on your description of the events, proper CPLR procedure to substitute the new plaintiff was not followed. Moreover, you say that the plaintiff is not registered in NY. In order for a foreign corporation doing business in New York to maintain any action or special proceeding in this state it must obtain a certificate of authority to do so and pay all state fees and taxes [see Business Corporations Law å¤1301 & å¤1312(a)]. The failure of a foreign corporation doing business in New York to register precludes that entity from ""maintaining"" an action or special proceeding until such authority is obtained [BCL å¤1312(a)]. As one of attorneys has said (Mr. Rothstein) you should file a motion to reargue. The filing of a motion to reargue does not stay the time you have to appeal. You should file a timely notice of appeal. Good luck."
1829903,I agree with my colleague and would add that just because an attorney was suspended does not automatically mean you have a viable malpractice case.  An attorney may violate ethical rules and this alone does not give rise to a malpractice claim.  Take your case to a legal malpractice attorney to have it evaluated and conduct your next steps from then on.  You only have a two year statute of limitations in litigated case from the end of the time for all appellate remedies.  You may also have to contact The Florida Bar to report your concerns.  I hope this helps.

For example, the business cannot be set up just to provide support for you and your family, it can't be a marginal business. From the cases I've dealt with, although no minimum investment is required, you have to make a substantial investment, probably around $100,000, my figure, which can include equipment, materials, inventory, etc., and the less money you invest, the more you are expected to be either the sole owner of the business or a substantial part of it.  Your country has to be on the Treaty Country list, which Canada is for either E-1 or E-2. This is somewhat complicated and you should discuss it with an immigration attorney."
1820995,When your husband was arrested the first time he wasn't convicted of the crime. An arrest may have little or no immigration effect. A conviction can have significant immigration consequences.

1805888,"Its an old, sleazy lawyer trick. Sleazy lawyers will treat pro se litigants with a grain of respect at best.  So they serve you with documents that they know they have to serve you with, because if you don't get them you will know they didn't send it.  They file a certificate or proof of service that says they served you, but didn't.  What you do to correct this is you make arrangements for either electronic access to your docket and check it every other day, or you make routine trips to the clerk's office and check the file.  Carefully make a list of all documents that you received and a list of all documents the court docket says were served on you, and then note the ones you did not receive.  Then you file a motion with the court, requesting that the opposing attorney be sanctioned for intentionally refusing to serve you with court papers as required under the rules and by law.  You can also file a bar complaint.  Another way is to associate with outside counsel, maybe a lawyer who will file a request for notices.  I am sorry to say but some lawyers feel they have to cheat to win; and this can happen."
1792292,"You need to request a court appointed attorney. If the prosecutor is not willing to dismiss the charges, you need to talk to an attorney about your case before you enter any agreement with the prosecutor. You need to understand your trial rights. Good luck."
1318257,"As a car accident lawyer, I'm typically on the other side of this type of case so while I wont give you advice, I will tell you what I would do for the boy's family.  The child's family has a 'wrongful death' action against you and I would expect you to turn their claim over to your car insurance company.  If covered, the insurance company will investigate the claim, defend you, and seek to protect you by attempting to settle the claim.  If settled, the claim will be resolved by a 'release' whereby once the settlement is concluded, your assets are no longer exposed for collection including your ERISA.  However, because the claim against you is a large one, I would investigate the ability to collect against you in addition to your auto insurance policy because there are circumstances where the policy limit of insurance is insufficient but the collection of additional funds over the policy is economically viable.  I would also see if you have additional protections available such as taking the lid off of your policy or seeking the addition of Cumis counsel.  If you had collectible assets in excess of your policy, I would likely seek a stipulated judgment from you that required you to make payments over time and in excess of your policy limit in order to satisfy the terms of the stipulated judgment.  If convicted, I would also look into seeking restitution from you through the criminal process.  If a settlement is not achieved and the wrongful death action results in a judgment against you, first indemnification would become payable from your insurer without your release.  Then your assets would be exposed to collection proceedings.  In order to perform collection, you could be brought back into court for a judgment debtor's examination wherein you would have to divulge all of your assets, holdings, interest, and wages.  With this information, I would seek writs to collect and garnish your assets and wages, including your ERISA holdings.  Upon the service of the writ or levy against your ERISA account, you could seek court intervention to prevent the execution of the writ and levy.  At that time, a judge would determine if your ERISA is safe.  ERISA affords statutory protection against this type of collection and you are likely protected so long as the account qualifies as a ERISA Plan account.  However, there are exceptions as the ERISA protections are not iron clad.  See: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-judgment-creditors-go-after-my-retirement-accounts.html Nonetheless, there would remain exposure for collection.  Just because the ERISA account cannot be pierced by a CA writ does not mean the res is not exposed.  Once you withdraw money from the ERISA account and place it outside of the ERISA account it is exposed to collection and attachment. Aside from your question, you mention that the boy was in the middle of the street at 9pm.  In the wrongful death action, you have the same comparative fault defenses that you would have in a motor vehicle negligence action.  Your auto insured should be investigating this portion of the loss as party of their duty to investigate."
1759101,"You have received very good answers already. I will only try to shed some light on actually getting your portion, because I only do work related to the division of retirement assets during a divorce.   1. When a portion of a spouse's pension is given to the other spouse during a divorce, a document known as a QDRO (qualified domestic relations order) will need to be prepared. For the preparation of a QDRO on your behalf, or to review a QDRO that the opposing party may have prepared, I will strongly encourage you to find a QDRO attorney to do it. Preparing these documents for the division of retirement assets in a divorce has to do more with retirement plan law than family law. A divorce attorney will be great to deal with bringing him back to court to force him to pay you the past installments (and you should hire one in your area), but when it comes to the enforcement of the division of a retirement asset, a QDRO attorney with experience working with retirement plans could be a better option for you.   2. Each party is at risk of losing a lot of benefits ($$$) when the QDRO is not properly written. Little words make big differences in the world of QDROs. Also, a lot could be lost if the QDRO is not drafted promptly within a reasonable time after the divorce.  3. You may need a local divorce attorney in the city where the divorce takes place to help you with going to court and represent you on the issues related to the divorce. BUT, for anything that has to do with writing or reviewing a QDRO, I would strongly encourage you to find an attorney, with experience in, and knowledge of, retirement plans and high sophistication with QDROs to do the actual preparation of the QDRO on your behalf (or to review a QDRO prepared by opposing party).   4. You don‰Ûªt need a local QDRO attorney because most likely federal law regulates the retirement plan to which the QDRO applies so any QDRO attorney in the country can help you. There are a few well-qualified QDRO attorneys across the country. Focus on finding a QDRO attorney, not just a family lawyer to do the actual preparation (or review) of the QDRO. Do your research before hiring.   5. QDROs are NOT neutral documents. You need your own QDRO attorney to draft or review the QDRO prepared by the opposing party‰Ûªs attorney. You need somebody who will look after your interests. I would be wary of anybody offering to prepare a QDRO for you and the other party, ""representing"" you both simultaneously.   6. Hiring a QDRO attorney in addition to your divorce attorney does not necessarily mean it will cost you more. QDRO attorneys usually charge a flat fee. The cost is worth it if you hire somebody who is a QDRO attorney with background on retirement plans. The flat fee cost is outweighed by the fact that your benefits will not be lost.   7. The Plan administrator may easily have approved a QDRO that complies with legal requirements regardless of whether the QDRO actually protects your interests. The Plan approval of a QDRO does not mean that the QDRO was properly drafted for your benefit. It only means the QDRO meets a few basic requirements mandated by law.   8.

1799606,"First, I have to question how your therapist found out what his therapist was treating him for, as there are laws that prevent any such disclosures except under limited circumstances.  Family courts do care if a parent is mentally ill.  The courts look at what is in the best interests of the children.  I suggest you consult with an experienced family law attorney about putting together a motion to the Court where you lay out your concerns with whatever facts and evidence you have and ask for a psychological evaluation of your ex-husband."
1796116,"the I-130 petitioner and other possible mint sponsors make a contract with the government, not with the beneficiary. if the person becomes a public charge before either becoming a citizen or working for 10 years (40 quarters) then the government can come to you for reimbursement of the benefit paid.

1796616,"I'll answer your second question first;  Yes, there is another way, other than garnishment, to collect on your judgment. You can execute on the judgment. This essentially means the sheriff goes out and siezes property or accounts owned by the judgment debtor (and, if necessary, sells them) until an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment is collected. You'll need to make sure that the judgment is ""docketed"" in each county where the judgment debtor owns any property.  A second way to ""collect,"" in a manner of speaking, is that you can wait. Once you docket the judgment in the county it serves as a lien against all property (located in that county) in which the judgment debtor has an interest. So, for example, if you know the judgment creditor owned some land that he would be likely to sell, you can docket your judgment and wait. When he tries to sell your lien of judgment will need to be paid off in order to give clean title to the purchaser. Your judgment is a valid lien against property for 10 years (Why would someone decide to wait so long? Post-judgment interest  at 10% beats the return on keeping it in a savings account.) There are some exceptions to what property can be executed on.   As to your first question:  The previous answer as to how to go about the Garnishment was correct. You're going to want to get in touch with an attorney. This is an area with technical requirements and where mistakes can be costly. If you'd like, I can help you out with this or put you in touch with a good friend of mine who does a ton of this type of work."

1809048,"I appreciate the other attorneys' concerns. However, the actual question has not been answered. What if the questioner is in a jurisdiction where euthanasia is legal, for example, has a terminal illness, and wants to work with an attorney to set things in order? Or if the questioner is asking because someone else in his or or family had already committed suicide, and they want to know if they can get information from the decedent's attorney?   I will answer the actual questions posed.  Anyone can get legal help. Lawyers in PA have to do their best to maintain a normal attorney-client relationship. Everything discussed between the lawyer and the client would generally be confidential and/or privileged if there is nothing else which placed it in jeopardy (e.g. if the discussions between the client and the lawyer were to further some criminal scheme like bring drugs to jail, etc.). There is also no rule which requires a lawyer to reveal anything about a client, except in very limited circumstances like the client lying to a judge. However, a lawyer can choose (and also choose not to) reveal things which he believes might prevent ""certain death or substantial bodily harm"", the client from committing a crime, etc.  However, if the case were that a client walked into a lawyer's office and said I want to commit suicide, make me an estate plan, this would be a very tough scenario in reality. Very few lawyers will say, ""Oh, sure, sign here, pay the retainer, give me time before you go through with your plan.""  Because there is an ethical requirement for a lawyer to make sure they represent the client's interests, if it were me, off the top of my head, I would be very cautious and see that interests other than estate planning -- namely, the life of the client -- is first and foremost protected.  Hope this helps. If you like my answer, please vote it as ""best answer""."
1827202,"Talk to the lawyer you already have.  If you paid them they may help you with this because it is a pretty simple process.  If you own a smartphone, then showing an email from your company is valid proof.  So you may have actually had it on you.  You want to try and do something about the FTA.  Some courts will dismiss them outright, some will change them to a civil penalty.  There are many options.  An FTA on your record is not good, especially if you find yourself in a situation that requires the court to set you a bond.

1736729,"I would tend to agree with my colleagues here.  Permitting can be an extremely fact intensive issue in litigation.  Generally, in Florida, if the contract required the contractor to pull a permit and he or she failed to do so, you would have a claim for breach of contract, and would of course have to establish damages stemming from the breach.   If the contract is silent, the work either requires a permit or it does not.  If the work required a permit, the inquiry shifts to whether the contractor substantially completed his or her work, and, if so, they may still be entitled to the reasonable value of work performed minus any damages you suffered due to the permitting issue.  The purpose of laying all of this out for you is to give you an idea what a lawsuit would entail, and that's why the best case scenario for you is to avoid a lawsuit.  I would highly recommend retaining a construction attorney to prepare a demand letter to the contractor to pull the necessary permits and finish the job.  Have you paid in full?  In the event the contractor refuses, you can hire another contractor to finish the job and go after the prior contractor for damages which would be, at a minimum, the amounts you paid beyond the original contract price.  One way or another, as mentioned above, the failure to pull a permit can result in some issues with selling the house in the event the City fines you for non-compliance or requires the permit and additional work before signing off on the job.  I am happy to answer any other questions you may have.  Good luck."

1817382,"Non-probate assets are not generally addressed in a Will, since the Will has no power over such assets.  For example, if there is an IRA designating decedent's wife to be the beneficiary, but decedent's Will says the IRA goes to decedent's brother, wife will get the IRA, and the provision in the Will will be ignored.  So there is not reason to mention non-probate assets (except for tangible personal property) in a Will.  Non-probate assets do not become a part of the residuary estate for distribution purposes.  If the Will specifies that all estate and inheritance tax and estate-related expenses be paid by the residuary estate, the non-probate assets would not be responsible for contribution to those taxes and expenses unless the residuary estate was inadequate to cover those expenses.  If the beneficiary of a non-probate asset predeceases the decedent, it would fall back into the residuary estate unless there was a backup beneficiary designated (for instance, on a life insurance policy).  Please note, however, that if a non-probate beneficiary survives the decedent, but dies before the non-probate beneficiary receives the non-probate asset, the asset would then become a part of the Beneficiary's residuary estate."

Very often, Plaintiffs and their counsel spend A LOT of time dealing with tedious details of the claim without first determining whether the law even applies or not. Same thing goes for discrimination. Title VII does not apply to businesses with less than 15 employees at a given time (however, depending on where the business is located, some local ordinances require as few as 5 employees). as a business owner - always have employees report their time accurately and keep these records.

2007422,"Generally, you can file a Application and Order of Wage Assignment for child support any time after the support order is made.  If you are concerned, you can file a motion for determination of arrears and ask for wage assignment in that motion too--but you will still need to submit your Child Support Case Registry form and issue Wage Assignment forms to the paying parent/spouse's employer.  The only limitation might be that if the wage assignment was stayed in the original orders, you might have to file a motion to get the stay vacated and then issue the wage assignment.   You can file any of these documents with the court via U.S. mail (with an extra copy to conform and a self-addressed, stamped envelope).  You can serve them on the employer and employee via U.S. mail too.  Otherwise, you can retain counsel to help you and they can get the paperwork filed and served or contact and hire a local process server to get your paperwork filed for you--they can generally use faxed copies for filing.  Some courts allow fax or email filings directly, but you will need to check with the court where your case is to find out their rules and restrictions.    As another attorney indicated in their answer, you can also go through the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS).  They were created and designed to help collect child support payments and have even more powers regarding collection efforts than the family court (because they can revoke driver's licenses and seize IRS tax refunds before the payments are issued and revoke passports).  In most cases, DCSS does not charge filing fees for collection efforts either.  So saving money is helpful.    Your case generally remains where it was opened.  If the supported child and both parents have all left the jurisdiction where the matter was initially filed, you can ask the court to change venue and move the case to another state where jurisdiction requirements are satisfied.  DCSS has the ability to connect to other DCSS courts throughout the U.S. if parties have moved and enforcement is complicated by multiple-relocations.    Hope this extra info helps a little.

1801962,"It is not possible to know whether there has been a deviation in the standard of care which was a substantial factor in your injuries based on your post.  Generally medical malpractice attorneys will look at the abdominal surgeries and see whether there were any surgical techniques or procedures that were done below the standard of care.  This could result in a bowel injury , from a trocar or mono-polar cautery, or from loss of blood supply causing ischemia.  It is also possible that the surgical technique was impeccable and above the standard of care and that partial or full bowel obstruction developed simply as a consequence of the underlying condition or the extensive abdominal surgeries in the first place.   The second area of review will be whether post operative care was appropriate or whether there were delays in recognizing a bowel obstruction which led to necrosis (death) of the bowel at a particular area requiring a resection of bowel and colostomy.  Again, this requires a detailed review of the entire medical chart including nurses notes, intake and output records, blood culture results, review of serial abdominal imaging, the abdominal physical exam, the progress notes, and many other factors.  Colostomies under the best of circumstances are difficult and it sounds like your placement may have been less than optimal which doesn't mean there was malpractice, it could mean that they were doing the best with what they had.  Another issue will be whether a colostomy was necessary from the get go because of the underlying condition or whether a delay made the colostomy necessary.  Again the variables are endless and only an attorney with a full command of the medical records and a full statement of all relevant facts will be able to evaluate this for you.  I hope that you can get your colostomy reversed and in a timely fashion and that you heal well."

1792223,"Without an attorney handling this for you, it's guesswork.  Generally, the rules that apply to how an award or settlement is arrived at in workers' compensation is that the arbitrator must take into account several factors, among them: your age, job description, medical treatment, opinions of medical providers or experts, AMA rating (if any), and permanent restrictions (if any).  The settlement won't be approved unless the arbitrator reviews the medical and it jibes with the settlement.  So if you had a SLAP tear and they settled it for 1% of a person as a whole, hopefully the arbitrator would find that extremely low and not approve it.  Likewise, if the rate calculated is not aligning with the wage rate, then they will flag that too.  Hard to know what's fair.  Fair is what you get offered and what you can prove.  It sounds like you had a really bad tear and will have some permanent restrictions.  Unless your job is sedentary, I find it hard to believe you'll ever be full duty.  I'm guessing this was THEIR doctor who said this.  Also, keep in mind the insurance adjuster is NOT your friend, but your nemesis.

A probate appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals normally takes approximately 18 months from the time the claim of appeal is filed.   This time period can be expedited by motion if there is a good reason.  Once the Court of Appeals makes its decision, the parties have an option to seek leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court.  This can typically take an additional 12 - 18 months.  There are several extremely good, very experienced attorneys in Michigan who, like me, do nothing but appeals.  I strongly recommend that you talk to some of them so that you can determine how to best protect your interests on appeal."
1797285,"Read your lease.  If your lease provides for 'pet rent' that is based on the number of animals then you can charge the pet rent against the security deposit.  If, on the other hand, your lease provides for a pet deposit then I do not believe you can charge a deposit against the security deposit unless you can establish actual damages.  You do have the option to post a 3 day notice requiring the cats to be immediately removed from the property.  However, you would then have to evict which will take you longer than 8/1 to complete."

1794977,"You should do your best to get an attorney. Since this is your first offense, an attorney may be able to negotiate a diversion program with the prosecutor and the court. In diversion programs the defendant is required to complete a period of probation with various conditions such as completing community service and theft deterrent programs, finishing school and staying out of trouble. If you successfully complete the program, the charges are dismissed.  If you are adjudicated delinquent, the record will not automatically disappear when you turn 18. Juvenile records for all but the most serious crimes can be sealed and later expunged (destroyed). The record can be sealed 6 months after you complete whatever punishment the court imposes and expunged 5 years after it is sealed. You will want an attorney to verify this is done, if you are adjudicated delinquent.   In cases like yours, the most common punishment is probation, but you should understand that petty theft is a first degree misdemeanor and the maximum possible punishment is up to 90 days confinement in a detention facility. The maximum fine is $250. Court costs are generally a few hundred too.   As far as picking a lawyer. Call a few for consultations. Most of us will do a free consultation. Choose one you like, one you feel comfortable talking with and who is responsive to your questions."
1810671,"Dear Buffalo Home Owner:  The police come and yell at you every time because until they investigate the complaint of an open burning, they cannot determine that again, you are preparing food at your fire pit. It is your right and privilege to cook outside with fire, and the duty of the police to respond to a complaint and investigate. You are caught in a cycle with a foreseeable outcome, since you know every time you cook s'mores over a fire, your neighbor will complain and the police will show up.  New York State does not have a legal civil lawsuit based on harassment. It would seem you cannot even complain to the police about the neighbor because you are burning outside. Just because the conduct is not a violation does not mean the police should ignore the neighbor's calls. You should realize that the police may become feel caught up in a neighbor vendetta and that you know exactly what will occur when you exercise your right to burn by making some s'mores. Each time the officers are dispatched to your home, they must hit the road and of course, devote time to you.  If your neighbor does not tell the other neighbors you are a drug dealer, the neighbor has not defamed you."

CCP 436 authorizes the court, upon a motion brought pursuant to CCP 435, to strike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in ""any pleading.""  Generally, an answer is a pleading.  Specifically, CCP section 435 defines ""pleading"" as ""a demurrer, ANSWER, complaint or cross-complaint.  Pursuant to CCP 435(b) and Rule 3.1322 of the California Rules of Court , you have 10 days from the date of service of an answer to file a responsive pleading such as a demurrer or a motion to strike."

1818764,"You have to take action under the Ill Human Rights act within 180 days of when you were told you would not be hired.  This would also require that either you were found not guilty or the case was dismissed. If you pleaded guilty in order to obtain supervision and the case was then later dismissed after you completed the supervision period, then you can only take action if you had the arrest expunged."
1804587,"If the Trustee did in fact take action to his benefit and to the detriment of the other grantor, that is most likely a breach of his fiduciary duty.

1789365,"You may want to consult with a family law attorney before you agree to give up your time sharing.  There are ramifications in doing this. This is not something you should do lightly.   To answer your question, if you did have to pay child support, you would likely be entitled to an offset based on what he owes you.  However, when you throw another state into the mix, you run the risk that the other State could get jurisdiction over your child.  Why you are not going after the $35k is confusing. That is a substantial sum of arrearages that you really should be collecting."

1816663,"Property division in a divorce is left to the discretion of a judge and based on the principles of fairness and equity. Once a gift is received, such as the house in this case, it becomes marital property subject to division by a judge. Just like you, your husband has a unique interest in the home, meaning he will get some value out of it in a divorce. Given his faults, if proven at trial, you have a greater possibility than not of keeping the home, if you so request, with some reasonable payout, or equity payout, to him. Regarding the children, supervised visitation is likely, if sufficient evidence of drug use and physical abuse is presented at trial. The trial judge will look closely to the children's best interest and how to best protect them and ensure they are safe. Drug addiction and/or physical abuse are classic facts to request supervised and limited visitation until such time as he keeps clean, rehabilitates and can prove his is fit to take care of the children without a threat to the wellbeing of the children."

She probably also needs to have the money to pay the taxes to stop the foreclosure, but she may have some time, although she should not wait on consulting with an attorney!  She will likely have to open probate to transfer the home to herself, unless it is in a trust or some type of joint ownership.  Many of us offer a free phone consultation so it's worth her picking up the phone and getting more information."
1687500,"Your problem is very simple; one of the simplest issues that I regularly run into in my practice (which focuses on cross-border business and tax law from a global perspective).   This general analysis assumes that the freelancer will indeed be providing independent personal services solely from France (and never from US) as a non-US person who is a French contractor when he returns to France:  When the freelancer is back in France, freelancer should tell the US boss that freelancer will be a foreign contractor performing services from France. The US company must FIRST enter into an agreement with the freelancer as a French contractor that complies with French labor law. My firm works with a top-notch French labor lawyer; we have assisted many US companies with drafting and executing the French contract at a VERY reasonable rate. This will protect the US employer from French labor law risk and corporate tax law risk, which will be very important for the US employer! A very small price to pay to comply with French corporate, employment, and tax laws!  SECOND, after executing that agreement, the freelancer should tell the employer that the US employer needs to get a W-8BEN from the freelancer. The freelancer just fills out name and address and the employer keeps this on file. This proves that the freelancer is not a US person. The employer does not need to file it with the IRS; the employer should however keep it on file in the event of an audit. THIRD, the freelancer should also prepare and sign a statement that the freelancer will perform all work from OUTSIDE the US.   With that relationship in place, the boss will compensate the freelancer as a foreign contractor, non-US person, performing work from outside the US. In that situation, the employer will not need to make any withholdings to the IRS, nor will the freelancer owe any US taxes on the compensation. The non-US freelancer will of course owe individual income taxes to the French tax authority.   That's it. Too easy!"
1828569,"I would be angry as well. Each policy is a separate contract that begins and ends with the policy period.  You need to get a new agent.  I don't think you would have a claim against them unless there is some sort of consumer protection laws in your state, but unlikely.  One good way to find out is to contact the insurance commissioner.  I attached a link below."
1789284,"You have a first amendment right to free speech.  As long as it is just you, I don't see how they could stop you if you are on public property.  If just you turns into 500 yous then they may be able to require a permit and along with that you may have to provide for security and assure them that your not going to cause a public disturbance.  If it is just you or a couple of yous or a few of yous then you should be good.  If you want to know for sure what might happen, just call the police department and ask them before you go just to get their take on it.  It doesn't matter if they are right or wrong as their being right or wrong would only be tested by a judge later on. If you want to make a point and be sure that the police is not going to try to prevent you from picketing, call them first."
1824722,"The short answer is ""it depends on your decree"". Generally speaking the move, if allowed, by the terms of the decree won't affect the child support and likely won't affect custody per se. However, take your decree to a lawyer and get it carefully reviewed."

1805523,"If you have agreed to a child support increase and signed the court order, you should start paying the increase regardless of when the paperwork is filed.  If you wait until the paperwork is signed by the court to send the increased amount, you will be in arrears and that can cause a mess if you have a child support case open. You will receive letter stating you are behind, they can try to take more out of your pay check, and report on your credit. I would be contacting you attorney to find out status of why the paperwork is not filed.  If the paperwork is not filed, the case could be dismissed by the court and then at that point you would have overpaid your child support.  It is better to be overpaid then behind."

As another attorney mentioned, I've also had luck getting a backdated COD for an older conviction in order to get a charge vacated.

1506434,"I live and work in Los Angeles and deal with accidents like yours all the time, so I am happy to answer your question. The answer to your question is your gut instinct is right in that you are not certain about your rights. Premises liability cases are always TOUGH.  They are KNOWN for not settling cases.  Moreover, I've handled cases against Walgreens and I already see some wholes in your case.  One big thing that jumped to my mind is that the parking lot is made of concrete which makes it tough to ""slip"" regardless of what substance is on the concrete.  More facts are needed to come to a final conclusion, but make no doubt about it, you should definitely hire a lawyer.   At our firm we always refer people to all kinds of doctors and chiropractor and our clients never pay anything upfront, not even a copay. The doctors are willing to do this because an attorney is on board. You are entitled to have your property damage, medical bills and future medical expenses PAID FOR BY THE OTHER PARTY'S INSURANCE. The attorney you hire will handle the claims process from start to finish. I've handled cases and referred clients to great doctors in the Los Angeles, CA area.   But you are going to need to see a specliast to even get a shot at getting future medical treatment from the Defenedant. Moreover it sounds like the accident is completely the other persons fault so you don't want this case to become a difficult one because of lack of inattention. The insurance company will make you believe that your case is worth very little... Regarding pain and suffering, you need to speak to an experienced attorney that can strategize your case. Just because you were in an accident doesn't mean you have pain and suffering, at least thats what the insurance companies think. Make no doubt about it you have a great case, but you need help from a professional. You are entitled to your medical bills being covered as well.   Do you feel that you are at the same medical condition that you were before the accident? As a basic premise I wouldn't handle your claim by yourself. The attorney you hired can likely refer you to a doctor, if you ask for one, who will see you with no upfront payment! I've done this many times to help my clients out. You should not wait a single day to hire a lawyer, we will advise you on the strategy of your case. There is no upfront cost to hire an attorney.   With a case like yours it seems like you have some good facts in order to get a high settlement, but your case definitely needs to be developed further to corroborate your story. The most important thing when building your case are: liability (were you at fault); how bad are your injuries to your body. A lot of these things sound like they are not complete yet in your case so its something that is worth hiring an attorney for in order to get a sense of whether you have a case and what the strategy would be for you to build a strong case! I've handled cases and/or spoken to clients in the Los Angeles, CA area.   Its very possible that your case is worth more than the $$$ that the insurance company will offer you by yourself. Make your life easier and call an attorney today, you won't regret it."
1790401,"I agree with Ms. Lowry. Have an attorney in your area review the order. Without knowing the exact terms of your order it is difficult to say whether the child has to go with his father. In addition, sometimes in a situation like this, the answer is a matter of subjective opinion. Usually, no - a parent is not allowed to flip flop dates. If so, then the other parent would effectively never be able to make plans. However, it would be better to avoid any allegations that you denied him possession. If the issue was before the Court, the Court may consider (1) the reasons if any he gave for changing the visitation dates multiple times, (2) when you made plans that now conflict with his newly elected dates, (3) whether his dates fall within July which is part of the default period in a Standard Possession Order, and (4) what are your plans with your son."

1815938,"It is unclear from your post what it is that the supervisor or company is asking you to do.  You refer to discrimination, but that too is unclear.  I also recommend that you reach out to counsel to address what is occurring.  From the gravity of your post, it is quite possible you need some legal assistance and I encourage you to not delay."
1800312,"You are on the right track by noticing all these seeming improprieties by the court appointed fiduciary.  You need to document all of them.  Second, because the court appointed him the court will also require a regular Accounting to be filed, and which must also be given to all interested parties, like yourself and your sister.  This periodic Accounting should list, assets on hand at the beginning of the accounting period, monies taken in, monies paid out, etc.etc.etc.  You can then go into court when the Accounting is filed and a hearing date is set, and there you can object to line items in the Accounting.  Clearly, it is best to have a legal professional assisting and appearing with you.  Your choice."
1793957,Any explanation from your lawyers regarding this?
810353,"As soon as a creditor recieves notice of bankruptcy, they must take immediate affirmative steps to comply with the automatic stay.   Generally, creditors must immediately release writs of garnishment and turn over any moneys garnished after the filing date.  If your attorney won't pursue the creditor, find one who will. I am one of a few attorneys in Oregon who specialize in consumer-rights litigation in bankruptcy court."
1798878,"If he's demanding you pay him or he'll report you to the police, then that is actually the crime of extortion.  In any case, you shouldn't post online about this, and if the cops call, don't talk to them and call an attorney."
1808167,"You said the landlord did not sign ""at the time"", did the landlord sign afterwards sometime? It's important to know if you have an enforceable lease.  If there is no signature, you are likely leasing month-to-month. You can give notice to the landlord 15 days in advance of your next rent due date that you will be leaving.  If there is a signature, there is an enforceable lease agreement. If you leave it is possible that the landlord could pursue the back rent.  My recommendation is to speak with your landlord about cancelling the lease. Explain the circumstances. Chances are the landlord will just let it go."
1808718,"This is a gift to you. The only person taxed on gifts - is the person making the gift (your grandmother). However, she has a lifetime exemption amount of $5.3M. If she has made other gifts exceeding that amount or if this gift to you will cause her to breach that threshold then, she will be taxed on the excess. But you, my friend, are safe. Alternatively, if she leaves you the house in her will, and you get it upon her passing, then you will get a stepped up basis, which means the deemed cost to you will be the fair market value on the date of death. That means that if you choose to sell the home at a later point in time, your gain will be [sale price] - [fair market value of the property on the date of death]. If she deeds it to you while alive, then for the purpose of a later sale, your deemed cost (basis) will be whatever she paid for it. And assuming she bought it a long time ago, you will have a large gain to recognize. So these are some of the things to think about. Obviously these are general statements. The precise solution will require exploring the details. Contact me if you want a more precise answer tuned to your exact facts. Thanks.   (Every thing that I am saying here is my opinion and it is not based on any particular case. My response is just unsupported general information. If it helps you to resolve an issue that's great but do not rely on it as legal advice because it is not based on the facts in your case and it is not based on any specific legal research. Answering this question creates no relationship between the writer and reader of the writing. I am not your attorney now, nor have I been on the past.)"
1819886,"I really do not believe that a prospective employer needs permission to contact prior employers. However, if the prospective employer tells the past employer that you gave permission, they would be more likely to ""open up"" and give information."
1789594,"I am sorry for the shabby treatment you received. An attorney is professionally/ethically obligated to be competent, prompt and diligent. You clearly deserve better than you got and apparently with the second firm, you did. Best of luck."
1808043,"Mr. Rothrock is correct. Most cases in Superior Court are ordered to mediation. A Judge only reviews a case if the case is scheduled for a hearing on a pending Motion or at trial. There is no ""screening"" process. You would be pretty upset if a Judge ""screened"" your case and threw it out without allowing you the opportunity to develop more evidence and present your case, wouldn't you? The system allows both parties time to conduct discovery. Getting the first 30 day extension of time to answer written discovery is standard. All either party has to do is file a Motion for extension of time with the Clerk before the initial 30 day period expires and the Clerk will grant that motion. I also agree that you should have an attorney look over your pleadings and the opposing party's pleadings just to make sure everything looks proper."
1796909,"Your employer can suspended if you were treated equally with other employees. It does not matter whether you are working full-time or part-time.

If you need further assistance you should contact an employment lawyer in your area."
1808791,"Your nephew cannot attend a public high school on F-1 student visa. An F-1 student cannot attend a public secondary school unless (1) he attends the secondary school for a period not in excess of 12 months and (2) demonstrates that he reimburses the school board the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of the education. Here is a link to further info on Foreign Students in Public Schools."
1803688,"My first question is ""how long ago did your ex's attorney take on the QDRO?""  My second question is:  ""did your ex's attorney hire out the drafting of the QDRO or is he/she doing it him/herself?""   If it's been in the ex's attorney's hands for more than three months, I would file a motion to compel or simply do the QDRO myself.  You would have to sign the QDRO before it goes to the court for approval.  The process is this:  Attorney contacts retirement administrator's attorneys and gets their requirements; drafts QDRO and sends to your attorney and administrator's attorneys for review.  You should get a copy of the draft.  Upon approval by the administrator's attorneys and you and your attorney, it gets sent to the court for judicial approval and filing.  Seems simple, but can be a bear if the draft QDRO doesn't pass muster with the administrator's attorneys and ERISA rules and laws.    Again, if nothing has happened for a few months you can either (1) have your attorney draft the QDO; (2) hire an outside company that writes QDROS; (3) file a motion to compel the drafting of the QDRO.  Before a motion can be filed, a good faith letter and attempt to get information must be made."
1826826,"Did you apply for the restraining order?  If so, you'll need to return to court and ask the judge to remove it.  If the R.O. is the result of a domestic violence case, you will need to contact the prosecuting attorney.  Best of luck.  How is the family suffering as a result of this r.o.?"

1806652,"Custody can be part of a Protection from Abuse order, at least for an interim period until you can go through the full custody process.  If your ex is abusing you and your children, you can ask a court for relief for all of you.  This can be complicated and you need to speak with an attorney who is familiar with family law issues surrounding domestic violence.  The situation you describe is not unusual, but you will need to be careful.  It would also be helpful for you to collect evidence on your ability to care for the children following your health issues."
1803063,"Unfortunately, they probably don't have an obligation to keep you on, especially since you indicated that you are unable to work. If you are unable to perform your job, and you are out of FMLA time, they likely don't have to hold your position. I strongly recommend that you contact a MS employment law attorney for a free consultation/evaluation, though.   If their surgeon made a mistake, you may have a civil claim for medical malpractice but that does not create a wrongful termination claim. You have to establish that the doctor's actions and/or inactions fell below the standard of care and that caused injury. Contact an experienced MS medical malpractice attorney for a consultation. Your records likely need to be reviewed by a MS attorney to determine the viability of the claim. Consultations are generally free, so you have nothing to lose. Also, the statute of limitations is typically very short in medical malpractice claims and it is going on one year, so you should contact an attorney asap.   I am sorry to hear about your difficulties and wish you a full recovery."
1800272,"If you want to stay on the safe side, then your best course is to secure licensing or not to use the logos.  Sports licensing is among the most litigious specialties in the trademark field.  Even if you have an arguable ""fair use"" defense, or other rationale for not paying licensing royalties, still, the expense of arguing your pet theory in court can be very expensive, and the goal of any team or league suing you will be to put you out of business by burying you in legal bills, without even having to take the case all the way to trial.  If you do want to approach potential licensors, with a pitch about your proposed app, I would recommend that you use the services of a lawyer; they still may not necessarily want to do business with you (or they may just steal your idea and do it themselves), but your chances of them taking you more seriously are improved if you work with someone who is a known quanitiy in the licensing field."
1821683,"The key here is WHERE you work - you said you were working at the UPS at the Richmond, Airport.  TSA has and is responsible for all security within the boundaries of federally controlled airports, i.e., where commercial planes to include cargo, fly in-and-out of.  As such, it may have been a condition of your employment to ""consent"" to such searches while WITHIN the boundaries of the airport.  If you are a union member, contact your steward immediately.  If not, talk to your supervisor and find out exactly what the problem is and if worse-comes-to-worse, can you accept another UPS position at another location not under TSA's control.  You should contact a Plaintiff's Employment Attorney - go to the NELA (Nat'l Employment Lawyers Ass'n) website and look for a member near you.  Good luck!"
1734285,It seems that you may want a preliminary hearing if you truly believe that there is no legitimate basis for anyone to be able to identify you as the person using the cards. But only you know if it's worth the risk since you know what you did or didn't do.
1819282,"The hope is they don't indict him, and keep it as a misdemeanor, but it often depends on the county. If serious felonies, it can be months before they are indicted. The only thing he can do is try for a Probable Cause hearing, or bond reductions, but 45 days isn't that long to be in custody. If you are worried about indictment, he would be charged with a felony, and I hope you have a lawyer, you need to consult with them, but 45 days isn't much."

You can also try to amend, refile and serve before the case is closed. If you are in the correct venue and the case did get dismissed, you may be able to motion to reopen the case (if there was already a lot done in the last case and you don't want to do it all over again). Lastly, you can just pay the filing fee, start a new case, and do it right this time."

1804154,"As the executor of the Will, you have to petition the court to get an order on Final Distribution on Waiver of Account and First and Final Report of Executor. You will need to do a Waiver of Accounting. The beneficiaries have to have to file a Receipt of Distribution. You should say you are going to go ahead and distribute according to the Will at that time. Afterwards if you want to provide more to each sibling, talk to a CPA about tax issues. Do this as an individual, not part of the probate process because the probate process will cause delays."

They are going to say that they did not contract with you or you breached the contract.   You can file a lawsuit based on the fact that you relied on what they said and purchased items.  If you can show they knew you purchased the items, then you are in better shape.   You may also be able to record a mechanics lien if you complied with the mechanics lien act."

1795436,"When you set up your LLC, it becomes a living entity.  Get it an EIN.  If it is multi-member LLC, you will need to file a Form 1065 Partnership Return and issue yourself a K-1, which follows to your own 1040 Income Tax Return.  If it is a single-member LLC, it is a pass-through entity, and you simply file a separate Schedule C on your 1040 Return for the LLC.  Even if the LLC does not earn any income, be sure to file the 1065 or Schedule C (showing expenses as well, if any) this spring.  As I recall, there is no minimum filing requirement threshold for an LLC.  You need to file your 1065 of Schedule C next year.  Be sure to speak to an accountant."
1804660,"If you have strong evidence that the will is NOT in your mother's handwriting but your brother's, I think you could absolutely find an attorney who would be willing to take the case on contingency depending on the value of the estate and your ability to pay/share costs.  It is true that a handwriting expert can be expensive but there are a few reasonable ones in the LA area and again, if it is obviously not your mother's handwriting, the costs of litigation could go down.   Additionally, Orange County is all e-filing which could additionally help reduce costs. Good job in getting the continuance and I encourage you to start talking to attorneys ASAP to start preparing your case."
1790555,"There has been a major issues about whether DOC has been properly giving ""good time"" in addition to ""earned time"" to people serving a DOC sentence and how it impacts the mandatory release date (MRD) for felons.

1803109,"As already stated, your friend would have to file for a Sentence Modification.  I can tell you that typically, the Public Defender's Office will not do this.  A sentence modification is not a stage that is considered critical to the defense of a charge that the public defender is meant to handle.  Therefore, she would either need to file on her own behalf or hire an attorney.  Further, the wait time for a female to get into the RSAT program ranges anywhere from 4-8 months.  The courts that sentence and the prosecutors who recommend this type of sentence typically understand this when they agree to the sentence and have probably taken the ""dead time"" into account.  While it is within the court's discretion to modify the sentence, my experience is that they will not modify these sentences until at least 6 months have passed and the person is still waiting for a bed.  The time your friend is spending in jail while waiting on her bed in RSAT will count toward any probation that she may have to serve when released."
1826539,"If you do not pay the water bill and the lease requires you to, then you would be liable and the landlord could collect from you. You are entitled (typically) to a statement of how much the meter ran during your stay and the landlord should have numbers for you. If you are concerned about the bill or think it suspicious, I would contact one of us directly to go through the matter with you. There are options open to you where you can make sure that the readings are accurate. In the end, if the lease requires you to pay for water, you will have to pay for the water you actually used."

1695764,"I disagree with my colleague that the process is complicated.  In my personal experience with my Los Angeles area clients, the process has been quite simple overall. You have more than a couple of options, but I'll mention 2 here:  a fiancÌ© visa or perhaps you might decide to get married while your loved one is a tourist. However, you would need to lack the intent to marry when your loved one first comes as a tourist. I would need to examine your situation in more detail to say more than that.  Good luck."
1794515,"Unfortunately, your ex is in the right here.  I'm not saying that he didn't hit your daughter, but it doesn't appear that you can PROVE he did so.  Just because you claim it happened doesn't mean social services is going to do anything about it.  The worker went to your ex, didn't see anything dangerous, and told the court as much.  I'm guessing you didn't take your daughter to the doctor, call the police, or otherwise generate any kind of objective proof of the incident.  That is where you made your mistake.  The problem is that many times one parent will make up a fake story against the other parent to mess with them - it happens all the time.  So, the standard you have to meet in order to restrict his parenting time is quite high.  You didn't meet that standard, and now you're in trouble for improperly restricting his parenting time.  You have to PROVE it happened, not just say it did."
1797719,"Life is not always fair.  Children do not have a right to inherit under a will. If the will expressly states ""I disinherit my son, Joe,"" the chances are good that Joe is out of luck unless he can prove that Dad action came as the result of fraud or undue influence or because Dad lacked the mental capacity to make a will. On the other hand, if Joe is not mentioned in the will, Joe may argue that he has a right of inheritance under the Omitted Child law and receive a fractional share of the assets.  As for the house -- Joe is out of luck. Property passes to a joint owner automatically at the death of the other owner, unless you can successfully prove that the deed is the product of fraud or undue influence..  The prisoner should try to find a probate attorney who will make a house call for further assistance."
1807099,"Until you have status, you are always vulnerable. Anything might happen in the year before you marry. Once you have applied for your residence, even if you are in proceedings the court will usually continue your case until USCIS has made its decision. Best outcome is that you stay out of removal proceedings and become safe as soon as you can. Because you are making serious marriage plans - and are not in some crazy rush - that says to me that the marriage is real and that will be obvious to the service. So as long as there is nothing that makes you ineligible for the benefit, you will likely be safe"
1805156,"I agree with both comments the preceded, but I  also wanted to make sure I'm understanding your question.  A police report and an investigator report are two different things.  A police report is the incident report and is generally completed immediately following a citation or arrest by the arresting police officer.  An investigative report often means person is being investigated for a crime, by local, state, or federal authorities.  They work closely with police, and the prosecution to determine if criminal charges should be brought.  Its a one sided report by the investigator.  It's not like the police report that you can request to review for accuracy.  In fact, you rarely if ever get to see it.  If an investigator calls the suspect, it's important that they do not provide any documentation, or answer any questions.   The exception to this is if there is subpoena or warrant.  Instead, find out who is investigating, what agency, and why.   All states made can be used against the suspect.   So it's important to consult a criminal defense attorney if the person is under investigation.  The attorney will need the information about who is investigating and why.  If hired for pre-indictment charges, the attorney's role is to protect the suspect from self-incrimination, and they will act as a wall between the investigator and the suspect.   The investigator will be contacted by the attorney, who will  let the investigator know that all communications need to go through them. In some cases the charges are never brought with those protections.  But in some cases, they still are.but often rights and defenses are well protected to use for the suspects defense in court.  The Attorney will usually request the investigative report once completed as part of the discovery and evidence gathering process."
1860062,Your options?  You should anticipate the conviction being discovered and being asked to explain it.  Whether or not the clearance is granted is entirely up to the U.S. Government.

1817386,"You always have the option of applying for the R-1 visa stamp at a US consulate in either Canada or Mexico as a ""Third Country National"" (""TCN"").  Most, if not all of the U.S.consulates in both of these countries, which are known as and popularly referred to as ""border posts"" will entertain your visa application there.  You need to got into the website of each consulate in question and read the special rules that apply for TCN applications and learn how to schedule a visa interview appointment. In your particular situation, both Vancouver and Tijuana will be good choices, with each having pros and cons. Depending on your nationality, you might also need to obtain a visitior's visa to Canada (their SF and SJ consulates are particularly nasty, LA is no big help either). You will be allowed to enter freely to Mexico, on foot or by car from San Diego, but should your visa be ultimately denied there, or submitted to ""security name check clearances"" that could last weeks or more, you will not be allowed back into the US side of the border and will need to fly back to your home country from Mexico. That is why if Mexico is what you elect, better apply for and obtain a Mexican visa prior to embarking on that adventure. Also note that with the R-1 category being fraught with (very) high perception of fraud, better discuss this with an attorney prior to making any such decision and perhaps you will be better off applying in your home country.."
1790211,You can talk to an attorney that handles these types of cases for free and see if they can assist you in filing a claim or getting the insurance company to begin working with you to get treatment and benefits. If there was a delay the insurance company will sometimes have a little more investigation to do because they will talk to the employer to see why it was not reported right away. An attorney can assist you if they want to do a recorded statement or need any additional information to get things going.
1814620,"Did you and the landlord document the condition of the carpet before you moved in?  The landlord may deduct cleaning and repair costs.  Unless the lease says otherwise, 30 to 60 days is considered to be a reasonable time during which the landlord can return the security deposit."

1796680,"Expungement is actually only for juvenile records. Adult records can be sealed, but not expunged. If you were not convicted you can apply to have the record sealed, provided you don't already have a significant record.   If the court grants the application, many employers will not be able to see the record any more. However, sealed records are open to some employers such as schools, hospitals and law enforcement agencies, and certain licensing agencies such as the pharmacy board.   While you can do this yourself, you should get a lawyer if you want it done right. That will maximize your chance of success. The court is not required to seal your record simply because you are eligible and apply."
1806080,"The best advice would be to set an appointment with an attorney who specializes in employment law and sexual harassment cases. Then after a thorough review of all of the facts, they can give you an opinion as to whether you have a viable claim, and what procedural steps you should take.  Many attorneys handle these cases on a contingency percentage fee, taking a percentage of the recovery. In contingency fee arrangements, there are no hourly fees.  In some states attorneys do not charge anything for an initial appointment to discuss your case but in others there is a reasonable fee charged to compensate the attorney for their time and advice.  I would suggest that you begin your search for an attorney on this Avvo website.  There is a tab ""Find A Lawyer"" on the home page of Avvo at www.avvo.com that will help you find a lawyer in this practice area in your locale. Good luck!"
1830107,"Most estates with a will are independently administered and never formally closed with the Court.  The Executor continues to have power to disburse the estate, and generally to sell most assets, regardless of the passage of time.  So, with an independent administration, the estate is usually closed by paying all debts, liquidating and distributing all of the assets.  No further court action is normally required."
1820719,"You may be listed as co-founder of a US company and also attend an occasional board meeting on F-1 status as long as your F-1 studies are the principal reason you are in the U.S.  If not, you will need to obtain a B-1 visa to attend board meetings.  Of course, if you start doing more than the occasional board meeting, then you will need either OPT or a visa that permits you to work."

The fact that you were admitted into the US legally, with a passport and visa, is great news since you will now, upon marriage to the USC, be able to immediately file for the ""green card"" and if done right the first time, with the help of a reputable and experienced immigration lawyer, obtain your 'green card"" within 4-5 months or less.  Kindly note these two facts below: 1 .  Spouse of US citizens are deemed to be ""Immediate Relatives"" (""IR"").

For now, you are free to go. Good luck."
1810420,"You certainly need an agreement granting you the right to the shares, which could be a Share Purchase Agreement, assignment of shares or even an option agreement.  The key is that the agreement should grant you the right now to execute/purchase at a later date, and expressly indicate that it is not conditioned on employment.  However, you also mention that you will both be on the same vesting schedule -- how these shares vest needs to be expressly set forth in your purchase agreement, but alos in an agreement between your partner and the company.    Separately, you absolutely will need By Laws and a Shareolders Agreement, which together will set forth the rights and obligations of the partners, management and control issues, restrictions on transfer, co-sale rights, perhaps a non-compete and other key provisions.  Lastly, and especially if there is intellectual property being contributed by the partners, each should sign an agreement assigning the IP rights to the Corporation.  As you can see, this is not a simple issue, and you should retain a corporate/business lawyer well-versed in these matters.  You also should review with counsel your hesitation to become a shareholder now based on the immigration issues as this may not be a reason to hold off from becoming a shareholder."

1796731,"Dear Buffalo Tenant:  I take it that your security deposit (or portion of the full security deposit) is held by the landlord as dictated by the terms of the lease. The lease likely does not allow for the landlord unilaterally to release any portion of the total deposit until the lease and tenancy are over.   If you and other persons are the named tenants on the lease, and you all agree to release you from the lease, that is best done with a written lease modification signed by all the existing tenants, the landlord and the replacement tenant. That agreement may provide for the new tenant to assume your interest in the security deposit in exchange for paying you that share with his own good funds.  Otherwise, he is not obliged to you for anything. If you want to create a binding agreement about the security and the tenancy it must be written and all affected persons including the landlord must sign. Otherwise, even were he to pay you for your share of the joint security deposit but the landlord is not in on the arrangement, when the lease is over, and the apartment is turned back to the landlord assuming no damage to the apartment, the landlord would return your share to you and not to your replacement."

If you can fit everything within the $2500 you should be OK, unless the trustee challenges value.  I doubt, however, he/she would have space or patience to deal with your junkers.

1810979,"Contact an experienced personal injury attorney in CA for a free consultation. Aside from the fact that we don't know what you signed, we also don't know why you fell. Even if the paperwork that you signed does not foreclose suit against the property, if there was nothing wrong with the stairs/staircase, then you don't have a claim. If you fell because you just accidentally tripped, that would not be the hotel's fault. If you fell because of something that the hotel did/didn't do and the doc you signed does not waive right to bring suit, then you may have a claim. Were the stairs defective? Was it dark? Was there water on the stairs? There are a lot of unanswered questions b/c not enough facts in your post. Also the paperwork you signed needs to be reviewed. If it was a waiver of right to bring suit, maybe that would be considered as against public policy but without seeing the document, there is no way for any of us attorneys to know."

Your child's father is likely to want to follow the law, and behave as responsibly as possible since those without immigration papers walk a very difficult tightrope. Maybe you have a better chance of collecting than from someone who has the documentation to move anywhere within the 50 states, find new work and start over.

2061016,"Why do you assume it is worth less? Any case with any injury lasting more than 6 months may be worth more than that.  Cases like yours can vary. Some lawyers build cases from the bottom up- meaning they start with the amount of bills and expenses. Or start from the top down- focusing on those intangible losses you have suffered such as loss of enjoyment of life, mental anguish and pain.  No calculator will add those up. We've seen people who have given up active play with their children, gardening, motorcycles and many other things that make a hard life good or a good life great.   Insurance carriers try to negotiate every dollar they can, because every $100 means millions in the end to the Board of Directors. Even in soft tissue injuries, those tissues stretch and scar, or cause corresponding pressure on nerves in the spinal cord, leaving behind permanent problems for some. I have had clients need surgeries years later because of a bulging disk and have their entire world collapse for what seemed inconsequential at the time. Insurance companies want you to settle as soon as possible and treat as little as possible. Attorneys matter. Carriers change their gameplan when a lawyer is involved. It seems like your injuries are more serious.   For that reason - and the misinformation by TV lawyers and referral services- is why people should consult lawyers who take the time like on sites like this. Because of the economy, more lawyers are jumping into personal injury and should stick to what they know. Personal injury law REQUIRES knowledge about medical science and biomechanics (the forces on a body in a wreck) far greater and more specific than you'd think. The other side has doctors and millions on their side to say nothing is wrong or fight the claim.   The more a law firm advertises, the less likely it is to give personal attention. If you order a cheeseburger, you don't often meet the chef. If you buy a shirt, you virtually never meet the designer.  But hiring a lawyer is different. A lawyer is your spokesperson. Unlike a burger or a shirt, it can be a relationship which will last a lifetime.   Give one of us a call to discuss this confidentially and for free."
1824482,"You should request language that provides the two of you will confer and agree on choice of colleges and that children will apply for loans and scholarships. If it is possible to set aside funds from the sale of a home or other asset to be deposited I to  529 account, that would help provide a cushion. Since your children will enter college in 6 and 8 years, respectively, it would be wise for both parties to contribute monthly to the 529 accounts In proportion to income effective immediately."

That being said, you are entitled to your records under HIPAA and state law; send a demand in writing, stating the date you were denied, the reason denied, who denied them and giving them a 2 week deadline.  You may have to pay a small fee under state law for copying the records.  Certain records, including notes of a mental health provider, are not required to be produced.  /Christopher E. Ezold/"
1806844,"Hello,  You would need to file a Motion to the court.  Stanislaus county has self help clinics where you may be able to obtain advice on how to prepare these documents if you do not want to retain counsel. Please keep in mind that if a form is not done correctly or a fee not paid, it will be kicked back to you and you will have to start all over again.  So it is recommended that you interview at least 3 attorneys from the Stanislaus county bar association to find one that suits your needs.  Good luck."
1834145,"Once you were out of the country for more than 30 days you should not have continued receiving benefits.  You will eventually have to pay the SSA the money they gave you during that period.  If your current benefits have ceased because you have the money in the bank, then you should go to SSA, ask where you can refund them their money, and then send it to them.  So long as the money sits in your bank you will be ineligible for SSI because it exceeds 2000$ and you might have to sit and wait for them to collect for a long time.    I'm sorry that I couldn't provide a clearer solution but sometimes the way that SSA doesn't allow for clear and concise solutions to issues such as this one.  I wish you the best of luck."

1827033,"Yes, you can fly domestically on a valid national passport, that is still possible, even in TX, except in small border town airports.  A flight to Hawaii is considered to be a domestic flight and all you'll need is your valid Mexican passport to cross the TSA airport security lines. Don't even think of showing your Matricula consular... That is not a recognizable or acceptable form of ID anywhere, let alone at an airport security line.  TSA agents are accustomed to regularly seeing international visitors traveling on their foreign passports, no problem, as long as valid and you look like in the picture.  A matricula will immediately alert them that there might be something wrong with your ID (and legal right to be in the US).  Indpendently of your upcoming travel, I strongly encourage you  to apply for DACA if you qualify."

1824519,"You can obtain corrected or even new original birth certificates from the Department of Vial Records in Springfield. Vital Records will require a certified copy of a properly worded order and the required form and fee in order to generate and send you new birth certificates. If you are able to secure new birth certificates, it would be advisable for you to order several. Unless this is done properly, they will send everything back to you without the new birth certificates so make sure that you have either consulted with an attorney or hired one unless you are absolutely certain you know how to handle this on your own."
1825695,"You may also want to consult with someone about filing a Rule 60 Motion to set aside the existing order if you truly did not have notice of the original proceedings.  Have an attorney in your area take a close look at the existing court file to see if the mother perjured herself to the Court when she got the Order that is currently in place.  It could be that she lied about how long they had been here in order to make a Judge think North Carolina had jurisdiction.  Even if you can't get the order thrown out, you can certainly have it modified.  There is case law that says an order indicating ""as the parties may agree"" is unenforcable and invalid."
1789639,"Since you were admitted as a tourist into the country it will be difficult to request a change of status within the first 60 days after your entry.

Absent some special facts or circumstances, simply filing C7 BK will not ""break"" a valid revocable trust.

Review the trust and BK petition with counsel competent in crossover issues involving BK and EP."
1799348,"I agree you should get a consult.  Do you really need to do an adoption (a very formal, lengthy proceeding), or would simply receiving custody do it?  Receiving custody can be done by filing a complaint  (and ""FD"" or ""non-dissolution / non-divorce"" complaint), along with a consent order (assuming both mom and dad will sign), is much simpler and quicker, and might address your concerns (ability to provide medical insurance, legal residence and authority, etc).  It also wouldn't relieve dad of support / college obligations, if that's an issue (adoption WOULD terminate all rights and responsibilities on his side except arrears).  I'd suggest looking for a consult (hopefully free) before taking anything."
1817282,"The law regarding HTO and subsequent DWLS changed about a year ago and is quite complicated. You need an experienced criminal defense attorney.  It depends on what the basis was for your HTO suspension. If you were HTO'd for 3 or more DWLS and the sole basis of your original license suspension was financial - (unpaid tickets, child support, no insurance, etc.) then a subsequent DWLS starts over again as a misdemeanor, not a felony.  There are some other exceptions to this law, such as having certain prior felonies on your record, whether you have DUI, fleeing eluding convictions, etc.  The point is that your new DWLS may not be able to be classified as a felony. A thorough review of your drivers license record and criminal history is required."
1784595,"You probably already know this but there is also a statute of limitations (deadline) by which a legal malpractice case must be filed.   If you haven't had luck finding an attorney on Avvo (keep in mind that YOU must contact an attorney directly since they cannot contact you first about a potential case -- Avvo is not a ""lawyer wanted"" board for plaintiffs), you might want to ""Google"" smaller law firms and solo practitioners in PA who tend to have lower overhead and might be willing to take the case.  Good luck."
1793914,"The first thing I'm going to say is that most MA family law attorneys offer free initial consultations and you should really take advantage of this.  Having an attorney talk to you about all the relevant details and fully assess your situation is the best way to get a realistic picture of your rights and obligations so that you can set reasonable expectations.  Based on what you've provided, I'd say it would be much more likely for a judge to enter orders that result in a ""walk away"" (everyone keeps what they came in with) than for a judge to order you receive any substantial portion of your spouse's assets.  Where two spouses haven't intermingled their financial lives and aren't financially interdependent, there's very little justification for splitting things up.  This is especially true where the spouses are young and have substantial future earning potential.  Where you two will be in one another's lives forever due to a child in common, there are a lot of very long term consequences to consider when making litigation decisions.  You should definitely strongly consider mediation or conciliation to try and resolve your differences amicably.  And because it's this important, I'll end on the same note I started: at least consult with a few attorneys so that they can explain the costs and benefits of seeking this split of assets."
1802216,"Although I agree with the other lawyers responding that a material witness recanting his trial testimony is grounds for relief from the verdict, it is unlikely that a motion for new trial will be timely.  The deadline for a motion for new trial under Rule 3.590 is 10 days after the verdict.  If your brother has already been sentenced, it is probably too late for a motion for new trial.  I suggest that your brother consider filing a motion for post-conviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850.  That is not an appeal, but is filed in the court that tried him"
1824958,"You may get several different opinions on this one, because the statutes do not specifically state how interest is to be figured on judgments for retroactive support (which is what I believe you are asking about), as opposed to child support arrears (a payment for current support which is not timely made). In my opinion, since the court ordered a payment plan, interest would be calculated at 12% per year, compounded monthly, for each payment starting on the date the payment was not made."
1820471,"Instead of worrying about this, go to the IRS website and request the transcript for the 2013 tax return. It is easy to do and contains all the information needed by the USCIS. You can get the transcript online and it only take a few minutes.  Good luck!"
1798545,"Wow, normally this could be corrected at the interview without a denial, but it is better to re-file as the record is still incomplete. you can file a motion to reconsider with the CIS if you already submitted the required biographic information by filing I-290B which is cheaper than re-filing but may take longer period for a decision. best bet is to consult and hire an attorney to review all documents."
1808481,"""Petty"" disputes are not generally addressed well by the courts, and if you constantly complain about them, the court can look at your like a litigious parent stirring the pot and complaining about ""silly"" things. Now, I'm not saying these behaviors aren't annoying, and at times, wrong. However, you need to be careful, and understand the potential affect complaining about them could have on your custody, especially if you are the primary custodian. Complaining too often could result in a ""Peter and the Wolf"" situation, where you complain too much, and when he does something really bad, the court won't believe you right away.  What you're dealing with now requires patience and time. If you gather yourself and plan, you can have the court address these things, but you will have to hire a good attorney and plan ahead if you really feel it is necessary to address them, and it would be done by filing an action against him for contempt of the custody order.  I suggest that you consult with a reputable attorney who understands how to be careful in these situations without running off and irritating the court.  Good luck!"
1798217,"I think you need a lawyer asap. Based on your post, your 75% contribution only kicks in after she applies for financial aid, so there is a good argument that you need not pay anything towards her education if she does not apply for (and use) financial aid and loans. Make sure to bring the divorce agreement and show it to an experienced family law attorney.  I understand that you do want her to go to college and want to force her to apply for loans to the extent possible. In order to move this forward, there may be a basis to ask for declaratory relief, i.e. that the court rule that you need not pay anything unless she applies for and uses loans first. Because time is of the essence a diligent attorney would explore doing this as an emergent application."
1810269,"It depends on who foreclosed.  If it was a first position mortgagee that foreclosed, the HOA was in junior position and the lien was extinguished at the foreclosure.  However, the underlying debt is still a personal obligation to the homeowner and the HOA can still sue on it.  Also, any unpaid assessments that accumulated after the foreclosure automatically constitute a new lien against the property under Arizona law.  HOA liens are senior to nearly every other kind of lien.  So, if it was not a first position mortgagee that foreclosed, the HOA liens are likely still good."
1809868,"You definitely should fight this. I suggest you contact Jamie Nutter at 302-855-9090. He handles Dewey Beach matters.

1826713,"Dear Clifton Park tenant:  You are likely fighting an uphill and not winning battle to prevent your HUD housing from going smoke free. It is HUD public policy to allow HUD supervised properties to become smoke free, and to fulfill that goal, HUD encourages property managers to make their properties smoke free.  See: http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=SmokeFreeHUDLetter.pdf  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=pdfowners.pdf  There is no constitutional right to be free to smoke, and so, no discrimination claims.   So unless you and other tenants are willing to hire a lawyer to take your landlord and HUD to court, there is not much an answering attorney at AVVO can do responding to your questions on this subject. But even with a lawsuit, the rising tide is in favor of turning multi-family dwellings smoke free as quickly as possible."
1828980,"Yes, the judge will sign off on a divorce if a couple is in the midst of a bankruptcy proceeding. As a judge, I did it all of the time.

1804803,"Your upcoming court date should be what's called an arraignment day. It is for you to come in and plead guilty or not guilty, make sure that you understand what crime you have been charged with and whether you intend to hire an attorney or apply for appointed counsel. If you hire a lawyer beforehand they will take care of this for you and you don't even have to go. We can't give you a fee quote on this public forum. All you have to do is call and ask. And don't pay Walmart."
1804708,"I suggest you contact his office and schedule a meeting with the attorney. Then, at the meeting, have him give you definitive answers as to what is being done regarding the matter and how long it will take. Have him give you specifics and have them in writing. If he is not willing to meet with you or are unhappy with the meeting outcome, you can always retain another attorney to handle this matter for you."

1793703,"I recommend that you consult with an employment lawyer. The lawyer should be able to satisfy the employer with the necessary proof and to consider whether litigation is justified. It is a shame that it has come to this point,  apparently resulting from the typo and lack of a professional letterhead and perhaps the breakdown of trust. Trust in the employer-emplyee relationship is quiye important. Good luck."
1807100,"Few, if any, courts will order a parent to pay for private school.  If your ex is willing to pay 100% of the cost you should consider it.   But if the public schools are great, you can elect to stick with them.  School changes require the agreement of both parents, or a court order is exceptional circumstances."
1800353,"Ms. Whitbeck is right.  And from the way you describe his requests to add days, it sounds like he's already talking to an attorney.  You are entitled to a consistent schedule and a reasonable custodial award.  But you risk losing out entirely if you don't have a lawyer.  The courts tend to favor a joint physical custody arrangement if it can be arranged, so unless you have some reason to believe the father is unable to care for the child, you should probably prepare for joint physical custody.  The court looks at everything from the perspective of what is in the child's best interest, believing it is in her best interest to have a strong and consistent relationship with both parents."
2219912,"In response to your first question, if criminal charges are filed for a summary offense, a summons --- not a warrant will issue.  Mr. Crawford has provided you with good advice.  Speak privately and confidentially with an experienced criminal defense attorney.  In response to your earlier comment, payment of the civil demand does NOT prevent the victim from making this into a criminal offense.  As crimes are charged against you in the name of the Commonwealth, a letter from loss prevention will not protect you.  Now, get that lawyer!  Good luck."
1825644,"Penal Code 836requires that the police witness a misdemeanor or, in the absence of same, there is a citizen's arrest.  If mom is the sole and critical witness, and no defendant confessed, her absence would mean her statements to the police would be hearsay.  Is that your question?"
1821644,"Any resolution at this point is possible.  The lack of reporting, and I assume you did not call in each months to probation either, is something judges generally frown upon.  You have some defenses to your lack of compliance but the biggest question that will be asked of you is ""why did you not call in at least, let us know where you were, and let us change where you should be reporting?  The answer to your question is that it is possible at this point but there are factors explained above that will make this a tough fight."
1788698,"You may or may not be liable for this debt.  First, check the written agreement you entered into with the 3rd party vendor for credit card processing.  More than likely, since this is or was an S-Corporation, the third party vendor required you to sign an individual guarantee on behalf of the corporation when you signed up for its service.  Most reputable banks will generally require an individual to guarantee any sizable loan or indebtedness on behalf of an S-Corporation.  This is done to protect the rights of the bank in the event of a default.  After all,  an S-corporation can be easily created or terminated.  Many have little in the way of tangible assets.  If you did guarantee the debt, you are on  the hook irrespective of the corporation's dissolution.  If you did not sign as an individual guarantor, you may still not be off the hook.  The vendor's alternative course of action could be to attempt to pursue you individually by ""piercing the corporate veil"".  This is a much more difficult and costly route.  Basically, to pierce the corporate veil, the creditor would have to prove in court that:  1) there was no real distinction between the corporation and you, as its owner;  2) you engaged in wrongful or fraudulent conduct;  and 3) the creditor suffered unjustly as a result of your conduct.  Given the amount of the debt we are talking about here, it would probably not be cost effective for this creditor to go to such great lengths to pierce the corporate veil.  If, however, there were more money at stake and/or other vendors similarly situated,  that could increase the likelihood of such a proceeding.   Piercing the corporate veil is neither cheap or easy to do.  You probably do not need a lawyer for this.  Just check the language of the agreement you signed with the vendor.  If you did not retain a copy, they should be able to produce a copy of the signed document to validate the debt.  I suspect that will answer your question.  Good luck!"
1813962,"Don't worry, this sort of thing happens far too often more than one would like.. Yes, your wife can renew both her EAD and I-131 at least 3 months prior to expiration, which is now. As for you, you better remain employed with the same employer through whom you obtained the green card for a little bit more, unless you absolutely cannot help it anymore and the work conditions became unbearable for you there or the employer is not keeping his promise to pay you the promised wage."
1824579,"Nobody really knows what happens next.  Technically, it's up to the person to whom the court ordered restitution to attempt to collect on what is now a civil judgment.  Often, they don't know how to do this.  If they do, you'll know when your bank account and/or paycheck are garnished.  You could either try to pay the judgment amount or sit back and wait to see if the ""victim"" knows how to collect on a judgment.  Chances are, they don't."
1829133,"Questions about the statute of limitations are quite common on general information sites such as this.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult for attorneys to state with any authority whether a charge is truly behind a person, and relying on the statute of limitations is very perilous.  Regardless of the specific statute at issue for a specific jurisdiction and charge, the real problem is that a suspect cannot know from what date the statute may run.  For drug conspiracies, the statute typically will not toll until the end of the conspiracy or acts in furtherance thereof, and federal or state investigators may well have continued to investigate criminal acts related to the marijuana possession long after the initial stop, thereby arguably giving them more lawful time to file formal charges.  Some federal investigations last for years after a traffic stop. The best advice for anyone concerned about possible charges in a specific case is to speak to retained or appointed counsel, who can advise about these and other issues, in a confidential setting. Good luck."
1814507,"Without reviewing the terms in the email and their website, it's not clear if this would be criminal fraud. You'd need someone to review the program, email, etc. But if something doesn't smell right that may tell you something. Good luck and get help if you need it."
1813872,"Employees in Texas are protected from discrimination based on pregnancy.  Employees are also protected from retaliation if the employee complains about pregnancy discrimination to the employer.  However, there is definitely more information that an attorney would need to know in evaluating your potential claim.  For example, did your manager make any negative comments about you being pregnant?  I think that it would be helpful for you to contact an employment attorney to discuss the specifics of your potential claim."
1686957,"This is a bad idea, and is in violation of the law.  Unless the workers are working directly under the control and direction and supervision of the owner and are paid by the owner, they cannot be used as ""independent contractors"" on such a job.  If you find them and hire them and give them work to do, they are your employees unless they each have of the group has their own contractor's licenses.  The Labor Code makes them your employees for purposes of workers compensation insurance and payment of hourly wages, and you would be liable if they were injured if you did not provide workers compensation insurance for them.  If you have employees and do not have workers compensation insurance for them, then your license is effectively suspended by operation of law, even if it otherwise appears that you have a valid contractor's license.  If that happens, then you could not collect money owed you in court, and the owner may be able to sue you for the return of all money they paid you, even if your work was perfect.  The License Board can also suspend or revoke your license for this conduct.  (See the Legal Article on this topic on our website)  Plus you may owe withholding etc to the State and the IRS on these workers.  Trying to skirt the law and hiring of unskilled ""independent contractors"" is not a good way to start out in the construction business, and could  result in a very short career as a contractor!"
1804021,"Even without having more background information, I would venture to say that his chances are not good, especially when seeking equal custody. You have apparently made all the decisions for your son. Biting his nails? A problem? I know many adults who bite their nails. If he does file a motion, make sure you retain an experienced family law attorney to represent you."
1826217,Generally speaking it could be good advice for the situation. The funds you are paying the wife could be fought over between the spouses so there's no reason for the husband to take any part of the money you are giving her to provide for her child. If you feel like you are at risk for not paying money to the wife you can always set that money aside in your own account and if back support is ordered then you have that money on the side without worrying about how to come up with a large sum of cash. BUT you should really be addressing these concerns with your lawyer.
1809439,"If will ultimately be up to USCIS to decide whether that is possible or not. You shall see what you shall see.  In my humble opinion (and previous experience) USCIS will take the position that one cannot transfer what one does not yet posses. In plain English: since you have not yet activated your future H-1B status by having started to work for the petitioning employer in H-1B status, you cannot prematurely seek to jump ship to another employer. Just wait, work for a week or two in Oct., then have the new employer file a new H-1b petition on your behalf. You will be able to start for the new employer as soon as his application is considered ""filed"" with USCIS."
1799007,"The affidavit of support is a contract between you and the federal government.  Your responsibilities will not end until either she becomes a citizen or she has worked for 40 qualifying quarters in US.    Many states do not enforce this contract.  But, both New York and New Jersey family courts clearly enforced this contract. I do not know if there is any other state starting to do it now.  if you are living in one of these two states, check out the case laws."
1795263,The whole purpose of preparing a brief is to allow the judge and staff to review your arguments before the trial or hearing takes place.  Offering up a brief at a hearing is a way of saying to the court that you want the hearing to stop so the court can read your important paperwork that you couldn't be bothered to give the court on time.  This is not a strategy that has ever worked for me.  Hope this perspective helps!
1967733,"Provisional waivers are for people who are present in the U.S. and are only inadmissible for having been unlawfully present.  The waivers do not cure prior removal orders or criminal matters.  However, you should look into reopening the prior removal case as that would possibly allow your husband to obtain proper status."
1806620,It also matters what you plan to do with your life.  You have to explain why PTD will work when deferred adjudication will not.  It sounds like you  have a good chance but you have to jump the hoops to provide everything required (including a clean drug test in Harris County) before you will be considered.

1811485,"Charges involving prescription drugs in Tennessee can be quite serious, but they can also be successfully defended and reduced in many cases.  If the defendant had valid prescriptions for everything in his or her possession, that is certainly a defense that should be discussed with an attorney in confidence.  Anyone facing such a charge should retain local counsel prior to court, and work with the attorney to defend the case, as the attorney will know the specific facts, court, and other important details.  General information in a public forum is no substitute for confidential advice from an attorney, so anyone who has a lawyer on such a case should continue trying to work with the attorney, or retain new counsel if unsatisfied with current counsel."
1798549,"28 min and still no answer, must have been a tough question. My personal perspective, I rarely find defense work worth doing, quite often the overall financial situation is suitable to a bankruptcy filing, so why waste resources on a piecemeal defense when you could resolve all of the issues at once. However, bankruptcy filings have been in decline for nearly 3 years and have dropped as much as 30% of the last 3 years. Immediately prior to that, say 2009-2011 the bankruptcy attorney market was flooded with new attorneys who facing a tough job market  just hung out a shingle and became ""bankruptcy"" attorneys. To their credit some of the new folks are very good at marketing, even if they haven't take the time to learn much about practice.   Nevertheless there are appropriate cases for consumer defense, and consumer rights, and there are lots of potential clients that need good attorneys.   First piece of advise, get paid for your work. Don't take the case without retainer or other means to pay you. You have to pay your bills to stay in business and you can't do this if you are always putting out fires for free.  Give clients a fair and accurate statement of anticipated expenses for the proposed course of action , show the value in your services for that cost, and then let them decide to pay for it before you agree to work. You can always have more than enough work to keep you busy way more time than you can work. The key is to have work that pays you for working. If you are over burdened by cases that do not pay the bills by necessity , things will not get done right or timely and you will get in trouble, legally, ethically, and financially.  It may be difficult to find someone who wants to train the competition, especially in a formalized consultant arrangement. However there are many competent attorneys who are willing to share their knowledge.. Look for local and specialized bar organizations/chapters , join trade associations,  online forums, and of course spend a substantial amount of time  reading the applicable statues and case law. As you meet experienced attorneys in the area,  ask specific questions  that show you have studied the underlying statues, rules of procedure, etc and put some effort into it. Do not fall in to the trap of just posting questions all the time for a quick answer. Anybody can get an answer, a good attorney knows why it is the correct answer and when /how it might change based on the circumstances."

However since you did not file the I-485 already you have to watch their overstay time when applying for the advance parole.  If you pass 6 months, you definitely don't want them to travel before getting their greencard.  Even if you don't pass 6 months, sometimes it's just a good idea to stay put until the greencard is issue due to risk."
1693801,"This is a complicated question and what you do here really turns on whether you do, in fact, owe the debt or whether you dispute it.  If you do owe it, making a payment now can be counter-productive to improving your credit.  If you dispute it, you have rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  This is the federal law that controls everything that can be on your credit report.  As a general rule, negative credit can stay on your reports for 7 years from the date of last activity.  As a result, if you do owe the debt and make a payment now, that will actually re-start the 7 year time period.  These blog posts may help you.  Get your free credit reports first as described below before you do anything so you have a full scope of your situation.

1798712,"Send the real estate agent a certified letter and state that you object to the refund of the earnest money.   The buyer is obligated to use best efforts and good faith in seeking financing based on circumstances that existed on the date the contract was signed.  If the buyer finds out after the date of the contract that he is being relocated, that does not eliminate his obligations under the contract.  You can sue to compel specific performance and require the buyer to complete closing and combine it with a claim for damages if the buyer does not complete the closing.  And then apply the security deposit to your damages; but you DO NOT refund the earnest money now.   If your buyer is relocating, the practical problem is one of collecting even if you get some judgment in your favor. Your current practical remedy is to agree to release the buyer from the contract and you keep the earnest money. The real estate agent is NOT entitled to keep any part of that earnest money deposit."

1799683,"The short answer is yes, the insurance company ""should"" pay for all of the damage done to your car. You should call and report the wreck to your car insurance if you have not done so already. After they do an initial evaluation, they will pay you for the amount the car was worth. Your insurance company will then seek to recover that money from the other driver's insurance. Work with your insurance company and they will help walk you through the process.   As has already been said, even though nobody was initially injured, soft tissue or joint injuries may take 24-48 hours to present themselves. Should you or any passenger in the car feel it necessary, please seek medical treatment to ensure nothing serious was damaged. If you do end up having medical bills or lost wages to collect, you will likely need the help of an experienced personal injury attorney.   I hope this helps, best of luck to you."

You should call your attorney or, if unrepresented, try calling the Judge's assistant for an explanation."
1809627,"Hi, Your mom's execution of powers of attorney is not a loss of her rights; instead it is an exercise of her rights.  The people appointed under powers of attorney (agents) are supposed to act in furtherance of her wishes and interests, unless her wishes would cause harm to your mom or others.  Just as your mom created the agency, she can terminate the agency if she no longer believes they are acting according to her wishes (they are working for her, so if and when she wants she can fire the scoundrel(s)).  She can appoint whomever she wishes (and who will agree) to act on her behalf as long as those individuals meet the legal requirements to act as agents in Florida.  If your mom is no longer competent, then guardianship proceedings may be necessary (a legal action where a Judge substitutes his/her judgment in the place of your mother because of her disability).  Your mother needs personal and confidential legal assistance.

Oral argument is not required.  However, if the Respondent shows up and you do not, they will get a chance to convince the appellate court that their position is righteous.  Keep in mind that oral argument rarely changes the outcome on appeal, but there are cases where it is critical.  Good luck to you."
1825189,"You can request default, but it is most unlikely you will get it.  At best, your opponent will be ordered to comply with discovery.

It is quality review on the basis for the decision. We still hold our breath until it actually clears.  Most of the time, it is fine.  It can result in a denial, but if it does, you still have appeal rights.  I wouldn't worry about it at this point because it is probably fine, and if it is not, there is nothing you can do anyway at this point except wait for the actual decision itself."

1816487,"I agree that a difficult situation exists since we are about 40 years removed from the date of your father's passing.  However, I would first check with the Probate Court in the county in which he passed.  If an estate was ever opened up to transfer property he would have owned at that time the Probate court would have the information.  Also, if he had a will it would have been admitted to the Probate court - so they would have a copy in this scenario.  I would imagine by now all of his property would have been disposed of (transferred, given away, etc.).  Start by contacting the probate court in the county where he passed, and then I would contact a probate attorney in your area for further assistance."
1805031,"Landlord has 30 days from the day you vacated the property to either return the security deposit or return less than the full amount of the security deposit with an itemized statement of expenses that were deducted from the security deposit.  Unfortunately, many landlords in Butler County are not experienced landlords, and they have little knowledge about what the law requires from them upon a lease termination.  Even worse, many do know what their obligations are but choose to ignore them and take money from the tenants they are not entitled to.  They do this because they frequently get away with because very few tenants ever take their landlords to court.  This is exactly why Ohio's statute regarding returning security deposits provides for the landlord to pay the tenant's attorney's fees if they tenant wins.  This provides tenants an opportunity and leverage.  You should seek an attorney to get your security deposit back, especially if you have evidence that the property did not suffer beyond reasonable wear and tear since you moved in."
1793597,"The important statute discussing guardianship is: NRS 159.191 and the Court should also be considering NRS 125.500(1). The important cases are: Litz v. Bennum, 111 Nev. 35, 38, 888 P.2d 438, 440 (1995); and Locklin v. Duka, 112 Nev. 1489, 1495-96, 929 P.2d 930, 934-35 (1996).  Essentially the argument is this: In Nevada, there is a parental preference meaning parents have preference over anyone else.  To overcome the presumption, a person seeking guardianship instead of leaving the kids with the parents must  show that the parent is unfit or other extraordinary circumstances. In Nevada, extraordinary circumstances sufficient to overcome the parental preference presumption are those  circumstances which result in serious detriment to the child. Factors which may be considered in evaluating whether such extraordinary circumstances exist include: abandonment or persistent neglect of the child by the parent; likelihood of serious physical or emotional harm to the child if placed in the parent's custody; extended, unjustifiable absence of parental custody; continuing neglect or abdication of parental responsibilities; provision of the child's physical, emotional and other needs by persons other than the parent over a significant period of time; the existence of a bonded relationship between the child and the non-parent custodian sufficient to cause significant emotional harm to the child in the  event of a change in custody; the age of the child during the period when his or her care is provided by a non-parent; the child's well-being has been substantially enhanced under the care of the non-parent; the extent of the parent's delay in seeking to acquire custody of the child; the demonstrated quality of the parent's commitment to raising the child; the likely degree of stability and security in the child's future with the parent; the extent to which the child's right to an education would be impaired while in the custody of the parent; and any other circumstances that would substantially and adversely impact the welfare of the child.    You and the parents should consult an attorney who practices in this area immediately to discuss your options for a trial."

1796070,"Yes, you can be sued for more than your deposit if you caused damage to the property that will cost more to repair than your deposit. The best defense is *always* pictures. Detailed fussy pictures, not real estate listing pictures. Open the cabinets and show under the sinks(s). Open the fridge and show it is clean. Landlords will frequently use emotion-evoking words, e.g. ""filthy"" and ""vermin-infested"" or ""urine-soaked"" in order to generate a sympathetic response from a court.   Facts are the best possible counter. Pictures show facts; adjectives evoke responses. Judges want to make decisions based on facts, not conclusions. Elizabeth Powell"
1823841,"This is quite a broad question that a Florida attorney well-versed in intellectual property law can help with. If someone is infringing on your intellectual property, general practice is to send a cease and desist letter, but the specific wording of the letter depends on the relief you are seeking as well as the extent you are well-protected (for example, will you be asserting common law rights in your trademark or is it registered with the USPTO?).

Depending on the specific situation, there may be enough to show change, at the very least, you may be able to alter the parenting time schedule (based on the best interests of the child) or prevent the ex boyfriend from being around your child.  PPO information is generally public record.  It may be important to look at the PPO file to determine what incident lead to the PPO in the first place.  Allegations that the boyfriend is dangerous and violent would certainly be helpful in making a change of either custody or parenting time as well as prohibiting contact.  An experienced attorney can help you file the appropriate paperwork as well as get access to the PPO information."

This is also contingent that you are offering to provide the child care in accordance with the Guidelines.  If you have an attorney please call them and hopefully they can work it out with his attorney.  If you do not have an attorney you should consider hiring an attorney.

1648057,"Hmmm.  It depends.  If the  ""disability insurance company through which I was insured through my previous employer"" was a long term disability insurance carrier, the answer is yes if you getting SSI (which I doubt) and no if you are getting SSDI.  But, if the insurance carrier was a workers' compensation insurance carrier, and your claim was for work related injuries, the answer is absolutely yes, unless your attorney who settled the claim included appropriate language in the settlement.  If this was workers' comp related, you need to report the settlement to SSA.  If it is an LTD claim, then you do NOT need to report it."

There is no point in letting you get a fresh start if you jump from the frying pan back into the fire.

1825135,"Probably the only way one would have to pay the other spouse something would, in your case, be if the other spouse became disabled during the marriage or your income was much greater than his. Taxes would be on your own in the year that ends after the marriage. When you say you share leasing, one would assume that means the cost of your rent, but if it means that is an element of your income then a bigger issue would be equitable divisions of marital property between you."
1794834,"As for filing it, its really not very different than filing for divorce, just that complaint has a few different things in it, essentially listing all the facts you need to qualify you.  You can file yourself or with an attorney, and obviously its possible you may not do it correctly.  And I doubt there will be many examples out there you can use for annulment whereas there would be for divorce.  Once filed, what you later need to do and how you can prove what you say and the evidence you need is another story.  All of it is for various reasons harder to do than a divorce because of the different/extra things you have to prove"

If the monied spouse paid some voluntary fees, but didn't sign a stipulation saying, essentially, ""this constitutes interim counsel fees with the ability of the non-monied spouse to request add'l fees at trial,"" then the non-monied spouse wouldn't be precluded form filing a motion asking for additional interim fees.  That's not to say s/he will get it, but they can ask.  Schedule a consult with a Bronx Divorce attorney for a full assessment."
1822229,"In the strictest sense of the word, SD does not ""require"" employers to provide worker's compensation insurance. However, in effect -- it's basically required.   Virtually all employers are required to ""secure the payment of compensation to the employer's employees...."" That's almost always done through what you've called worker's comp insurance. Some employers may be excluded from the insurance requirement if they prove to the state that they are sufficiently solvent to qualify as a self-insured employer. Technically that's not ""insurance"" but it accomplishes the same thing. Also, there are some employers that are exempt, for example, the state and municipalities aren't required to carry workman's comp insurance (but can if they choose).  There are also some types of employees who are exempt from the workers' compensation laws, (farm laborers, some real estate brokers, some owner-operators of trucks).  You should contact the Workers' Compensation program within the Division of Labor & Management if you have concern that your employer is not providing the required coverage.

1807024,"To begin with, it sounds like the estate does not have sufficient assets. If that's true, you should consider whether to pursue the claim. It sounds like throwing good money after bad. But generally speaking, the claim survives the death of a party but nonetheless there are rules. In Georgia, once notice of the death is made on the record the surviving party has 6 months to assure the estate has been properly substituted. I recommend that you not wait on the estate's administrator. It's up to the plaintiff to cause the substitution and if the plaintiff fails to timely substitute, the claim will be dismissed."
1804084,"You may not be able to stop him from establishing paternity. However, if you can prove he is as dangerous as you say, you may be able to prevent him from obtaining any parenting time without substantial costs and steps on his part. When you combine that with the fact that he is facing liability for child support, this may be an opportunity to convince him that consenting to the adoption is in his best interest.   To protect your child and put your family in the best possible position to have its needs met, you should seek to consult with a competent family law attorney."
1810097,"The best advice in such a situation is almost always for the individual to retain a good local defense attorney, so as to discuss options in a confidential setting.  In a general information discussion forum, it is not possible to evaluate specific cases and details, or to provide the best strategy moving forward.  In some cases, it may be possible to avoid criminal charges by demonstrating remorse and paying back any misappropriated money.  However, if a person makes admissions and repays the money without a lawyer, those admissions and repayment could certainly be taken as admissions of guilt, which could form the basis for a criminal prosecution and conviction.  An attorney may be able to resolve the case without such actions being deemed as admissible evidence, and thus without losing the leverage to possibly fight the case if charges are filed.  An individual in this situation who makes admissions without an attorney may be able to avoid charges, but he or she is then really placing her fate in the hands of the employer and alleged victim(s), and local prosecutors, who may pursue criminal charges notwithstanding efforts to make it right."
1822580,"You can dispute the debt.  From the facts as you presented them, there does not seem to be a contract between you and the CPA for preparation of tax returns for the year in question.  If there is no valid contract, then there can be no breach of contract for which the CPA would be entitled to payment.  The CPA could only sue under a theory of unjust enrichment, which might be pretty hard to prove under the facts as you presented them.  If he does sue you, retain counsel immediately."
1827046,"Unless your HOA is using a lawyer or debt collector, no one is obligated to do anything other than send you an invoice for your monthly dues or assessments, and indicate on there all late fees, and accrued balances.  Will you have to pay attorney fees and late fees? Probably. Almost all CCR's in an HOA include provisions for late fees and attorney's fees if you're late or in default.   You can try negotiating with the association, request mediation with the court, etc.  There is no stated time limit on service, only that the process server sign the return of service and file it within the same time in which a defendant must answer.  If you are served on July 1 and have 30 days, then the process server must file the return of service stating you were served by July 31.   In federal court there's a 120 day rule but most courts allow the plaintiff several extensions of time to serve if its a difficult serve.

In fact, there is no ""general contractor's license"" for commercial work in NYC.  Instead, you should register as a general contractor with NYC DOB.

If, however, she is given temporary or permanent possession of the computer and you do not immediately remove the keylogger, then you risking very serious criminal charges.  It is possible that the District Attorney will prosecute such a case.  I have seen this happen.  I have no idea what kind of ""evidence"" you think you will learn that will be helpful to you.  It is unlikely you will find anything that a Court will actually pay attention to and you are taking a huge risk with your freedom (prison is not a fun place to live).  Perhaps if you discover that she has large hidden bank accounts or other assets hidden away that she is not disclosing you will have something that a judge would be interested in hearing about.  If, however, your goal is to catch her cheating on you or putting up personal ads on Match.com, you need to know that you are wasting your time.  Colorado divorce law is ""no-fault"".  This means that infidelity has no legal impact on a divorce settlement.  The judge won't even listen to the accusations.  By far the people most excited about Colorado law in this regard are judges.  Any evidence related to her social life or her sex life will be completely worthless to you."
1793589,"They should be able to. They have the resources and technology to do so. I can pretty much guarantee they won't though. As a former police officer, departments are careful about using IP addresses and other technologies such as Find My iPhone to track down stolen items. Getting a conviction in these cases can be difficult and police typically prioritize these cases low. They might, for example, use this technology in a murder case. You may want to contact Durham PD anyways and ask them to follow up on this."
1818729,"Yes. you can petition for her.  There is no new law yet.  There was a bill that passed the Senate, but it is not law, because the House of Representatives won't address it.  So it is not law.  However, that bill did contain a provision to eliminate the category of brother/sister of U.S. citizen.  It may be a signal that such a provision might be included in future attempts to change the law.  No one can say now, but I imagine it would not work to eliminate people who are already in the ""waiting line.""  More likely, any such future change would eliminate the category going forward.  Therefore, if you are in this situation, I'd say go ahead and do it. Note, however, there may be other considerations that are way too much to go into here.  For example, given the hugely long waiting line in that category, will it affect her ability to get a temporary visa in the meantime.  It may, if not prepared properly.  There are good arguments to make in preparing the non-immigrant visa application.  Again, as always, for these reasons, you should have your own personal and confidential detailed (1 hour-long) meeting with an experienced immigration lawyer."

1792107,"Meet an attorney no matter what you do as most do not charge for that first meeting. They can help you enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not found one yet and finding a PRO BONO may be hard.  You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what. Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can. You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of  waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then!   The collection proceedings IF they resulted in a judgment may affect you IF you own a house or real estate. Otherwise, it does not affect much if you were not sued yet as the debt owed is a debt owed, no matter who they assign it to!   Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."
1816017,"Without anything further this case is likely dead on arrival at the district attorney's office.  Additionally,  you should contact a civil attorney who sue the police for wrongful arrest.

1792615,"Well, it kind of depends on your Marital Estate's relative wealth and how substantial this sum is.  The court would have made an ""Equitable Division"" of your assets.  An Equitable Division, by definition, is made by considering the magnitude of the marital estate.  You marital estate was inflated by this deposit.  You share of the marital estate was probably overstated (money in ""your"" account) so your share was probably impacted.  In other words, your entire marital division was based upon a giant, good faith, mutual mistake.  How much that cost you is relevant to how the cost of repayment should be borne.  There is no question you and ex are liable for the amount.  The circumstances exclude all presumption of ""gift"".  I think you need to make a real effort to go back to  your original divorce lawyer and find out how to retrofit this thing.  Now, if your marital estate was $500,000. and the mistake was $50,000, that's a significant distortion.  If your ME was two million and the windfall $10k, not so much.  At a minimum, you, ex and accountant should all sit down and decide how to share the pain, but not before you have talked privately to a lawyer."

It does not hurt to have the child added to your plan and would only be seen as an additional benefit.  If you are asking to have one plan implemented over another one, you would have to look at the Agreement or Judgment to determine what applies, particularly who has veto power over any cancellation or payments."
1810202,"If you have a written contract, you should carefully review it and determine if there are any provisions you could use to help you out. If there is no written contract you should probably talk with a lawyer who can review and evaluate the case in more detail. If you don't pay and they are litigious then they will likely attempt to make your life miserable, which gives you a counterclaim or two at best. Depending on how aggressive you want to be, a demand letter from your lawyer might get their attention - or just infuriate them. It all depends on some specifics that someone should take more of a look at offline. Best of luck"
2119703,It's more important that you have a lawyer you have confidence in.  It's not absolutely necessarily that the lawyer has to have a license in Arkansas.  Lots of times lawyers from one state petition the court to allow them to handle one particular case in a state where the don't have a license.  I don't know what the procedure is called off the top of my head.  It's also very common for attorneys in major cases to bring in 'local counsel' to get around problems like this.  I know an excellent trial lawyer who maybe licensed in both Texas and Arkansas.  Do you want me to contact him for you?
1828266,"Your question isn't clear.  If any court ordered DNA testing, most other courts would respect that request and consider the results admissible evidence in a paternity case.

Also, pursuant to the Court Rules you should have attached to your original motion any agreements, judgments or orders that you were relying on as part of your application.  In addition, you should have attached any evidence that you wanted the court to consider.  In your reply certification you should attach any documents, orders and other evidence you want the court to review.

""Probating an estate"", as it is called, isn't necessarily the most straight forward thing in the world.  Many attorneys offer low cost or free consultations to help you understand what you need to do, so you can figure out whether or not it's worth it for you to retain one.  If you are determined to go it alone, you should go to the Plymouth County Probate and Family Court (the one in Plymouth on Obery Street, not the one on Main Street in Brockton) and ask the people in the registry for the paperwork you need to probate your father's estate.  They can't provide you with legal advice, but they can give you a copy of all of the forms so that you can be sure you have them all.  I've categorized your question so that appropriate attorneys can see it."

What is most interesting about the Chapter 13 is the work a litigator can accomplish with dealing with proofs of claims. Also, sometimes not 100 percent of unsecured creditors file proofs of claims. Where they do not file a proof of claim you should work with your attorney to disallow the claim, meaning not pay as their failure to file a proof of claim releases you of liability. Our book which is available online at sulaimanlaw.com discusses proofs of claim. Recent cases out in the last two weeks make it even harder for creditors to even file proofs of claim. Have a good day. Ahmad"
1807906,"I think you have things backwards: The person who initiates a patent infringement lawsuit [in your vernacular, ""infringment plaintiffs""] IS the inventor or the manufacturer who licensed the patent from the inventor. They cannot be accused of patent infringement because they own or license the patent. It is they who accuse others.  SOMETIMES a company that is making, selling or importing a product is accused by a patent owner of infringement and, in response, the company files a ""declaratory judgment"" lawsuit to put the infringement issue before a court. In that situation, the accused infringer IS the plaintiff -- but in name only. The burden remains on the patent owner to prove the infringement.   SOMETIMES a company that is making, selling or importing a product is sued for patent infringement and, in response, the company ""counterclaims"" against the patent owner, and perhaps joins others into the case, accusing that patent owner or those others of doing bad things -- like infringing THAT company's patents or interfering with THAT company's business. In that situation, the proper counterclaimant may be the inventor of whatever is claimed in the patent that started the lawsuit if that inventor participated in any of the alleged wrongdoing [like stealing trade secrets and using them to invent whatever was patented].  So the short answer to your question is, no, it is not common for an inventor to be sued in a patent infringment lawsuit. But maybe. Speak with your own intellectual property litigation attorney to discuss the specific facts of your situation.  Good luck."

1822353,"There are very significant differences.  A 5K motion is a motion to reduce sentence filed by the government, based on a defendant's ""substantial assistance"" (cooperation) with the government in investigating or prosecuting other cases. Such a motion can allow a court to sentence below a mandatory minimum term or applicable guidelines.  The ""safety valve"" guideline (and statute) applies to defendants with minimal criminal history, and it permits a court to sentence a defendant below a mandatory minimum term, and provides a reduction under the sentencing guidelines.  Typically, a defendant need not provide ""substantial assistance"" in other cases to qualify, but must give a truthful statement about the defendant's own involvement.  Federal sentencing is complex, and there is truly no way to discuss all the different aspects of the safety valve provisions in a general discussion forum.  Nor is there way way to determine whether a particular defendant would qualify in this forum.  Anyone facing a federal prosecution should be working with experienced defense counsel to review all sentencing options, including safety valve and possible 5K.  Many other sentencing considerations will also come in to play, and will need to be discussed with an appointed or retained attorney."

Bottom line, the landlord has to make reasonable efforts to find a new tenant, If he finds one right away, then he has to return your deposit minus advertising costs etc. If it takes him a month, he can keep one month's rent.

The cop also knows that ""impeding traffic"" involves no points on your driving record, therefore, there is less reason for you to fight.  This is a situation where you possibly should fight the ticket by representing yourself.  If you do, ask the prosecutor for ""discovery"" of any recording made from the car.  Many police cars record using dash-cam video.  The video might help prove you innocent.  If the video was destroyed, one could argue that the officer would not destroy a video that proves he is telling the truth.  Since there is no chance of imprisonment for you on this ticket, you do not have the right to a jury, and the judge alone would decide on guilt or innocence.  Good luck."
1825124,"A federal probationer does need permission to travel outside the jurisdiction of conviction, and outside of the United States.  Experienced federal criminal defense attorneys routinely file such motions with the court, and they are often granted where a probationer has a track record of success and legitimate reasons for the travel.  A probation officer can grant permission on his own, but some probation officers insist on a court order for international travel.  Moreover, where a probation officer denies permission,  a petition to the court will be needed.  An attorney (whether a newly retained attorney, appointed attorney, or most likely the attorney who originally handled the case) will give the probationer the best chance at success with such a motion, as opposed to the probationer pursuing it on her own.  There may also be issues with travelling across the Canadian border, as that country is very strict about admitting felons and those on supervision.  Dual citizenship will likely make this much easier than for an American, but it is likely wise to contact the Canadian Embassy for advice, or an immigration lawyer in the area.  Good luck to anyone trying to complete federal probation and trying to remain in compliance with all conditions.

1811460,". Dear Merrick Home Owner:  How did you provide information to the tenant to ""make up the money or move."" All you really needed to do was serve a rent demand (a statutory three day notice) and that would cover both options. A landlord may afford the tenant more than the minimum allowed three days to pay the back rent (and may need more if required by the lease) but the form of notice demands the rent is paid or the tenant moves out. Whatever information or notice you gave the tenant about paying or moving may be a proper notice or not, but you will need a lawyer to let you know, for sure.  Generally, the nonpayment summary proceeding is seen as the swiftest method to bring a tenant to court. And, should you be so lucky as to have the tenant come up with money from another source, if you still have a right to end the lease early, for personal use, you could do so. Another helpful aspect of the nonpayment proceeding is that you get into court, quickly. Then you and your attorney and the tenant and tenant attorney may make a deal. Typically, a judge will not mind if a landlord and tenant decide to settle a nonpayment case with the tenant agreeing to move out and the landlord agreeing to give up the rent.  These are strategies to discuss with your lawyer. This is not to do on your own considering your plans and the amount of money owed.  A holdover proceeding may exist in relation to a tenant only when the lease or tenancy expired or when the landlord exercises a right reserved in the lease where early termination is allowed. That presents a so-called ""winnable"" lawsuit, but all your rights depend on doing the legal work correctly.   If the lease provides a right to give notice of accelerated expiration of the lease based upon owner's need for personal use, then assuming the landlord adheres to the lease notice requirement, then a holdover proceeding may be proper.  Otherwise, the landlord must rely on a default term of the lease. Or seek possession by nonpayment proceeding.  Since the lease controls your rights, allow an attorney to help you decide on the form of summary proceeding."

If you never filed a claim, and your LTD policy is no longer effective, it is unlikely that you are still covered by the policy.  If you applied for LTD benefits, and filed an Administrative Appeal after being denied, it is possible that you may still be able to file a federal lawsuit, but it would depend on the terms of your policy and your State's Statute of Limitations for filing a contract claim.  Normally LTD claims are governed by the Federal ERISA statute (if this was a policy offered by your employer). I would suggest searching for an attorney that handles ERISA claims. However, even if there is a valid claim to still pursue your LTD benefits, the additional question is the benefit that you will be eligible for if you can prove your are indeed eligible.  If your LTD benefit was an employer offered benefit, it is likely that any amount you receive from Social Security, reduces your eligibility for LTD. Normally LTD policies have terms that indicate that you are required to apply for Social Security Disability, and if you are approved, you must repay any amount that you entitled to from Social Security Disability to the LTD company for up to the full amount of your LTD benefit for any months that you are eligible for both payments. There is normally a minimum benefit payable from your LTD company if your Social Security Disability amount is the same or higher than your LTD benefit. LTD companies also normally limit payment for mental health conditions to 2 years, and limit payments because you cannot perform your past work for 2 years. After 2 years, if you are disabled as a result of mental health, or you have the ability to perform any full-time work, your benefits are normally terminated.   If your LTD policy has these clauses in it, although it is possible that you may still have some rights to pursue a claim (if you were denied, properly appealed, and are still within your Federal Appeal deadline), there may not be a lot of money for you if you are successful. It is possible it could cost you more to pursue than you would ever receive.  I would recommend that you collect all relevant information and contact an attorney in your state that handles ERISA claims. It is important that you have a copy of your LTD policy, and any documentation that you have if you previously received benefits, or filed a claim and you were denied."
1808889,"Thanks for your question. Recently, in Escambia County, Florida we have had a number of trials against tobacco companies. The trials seem to go on for weeks and weeks. The law firms on both sides are very experienced, staffed with talented attorneys, and are armed with the ability to spend large amounts of money. These types of cases can be extremely expensive which means that the cases are evaluated very carefully before a suit is filed. These cases can be based on product liability, negligent advertising, fraud or other legal theories. The bottom line is that most of these cases do not reach a settlement which means that they may go on for years. You should research experienced law firms which deal in tobacco litigation in both Florida and Missouri for more information. You will likely need to have your mother's medical records as well. Good luck."
1805127,"Your fact pattern is confusing, but if I understand right you rented your trailer to a tenant which is located on land that you rent and the tenant is arguing that you cannot throw him out because renting to him violated a prohibition on subletting in your agreement with the landowner.  Is that right?  A tenant cannot evict their landlord.  If you are violating the terms of your lot agreement, that is between you and your landlord, not between you and the tenant.  If the tenant establishes that his tenancy violates the landowner's rights, then he will simply be establishing an ADDITIONAL reason that he has to leave."

1825767,"It's difficult to give you a certain answer as to what specific amount you should settle for. Ultimately, the decision will come down to you taking into consideration all factors and circumstances surrounding your injuries. Many personal injury attorneys will try and obtain a settlement that pays off an individual's medical bills, accounts for their pain and suffering, and compensates them for any lost wages. For the most part, a personal injury attorney will calculate an individual's pain and suffering by taking the sum of their medical bills and lost wages and multiplying that amount by a certain number. However, insurance companies are not required to value pain and suffering in the same manner. Instead, insurance companies will look to various factors such as the length of time you received medical treatment and the specific type of injury you suffered. For example, if you have suffered a permanent disability or disfigurement, you may want to consider increasing the value of your pain and suffering. If you haven't already done so, be sure to contact a personal injury attorney in your area to provide you with more advice regarding this matter. Best of luck to you.

1807184,Falsifying (forgery) of your information is a crime. She is clearly cleaning you out little by little and even willing to commit a crime to do so. I would call the police if you want to put an end to her treachery. You must understand that the results of that police investigation will be forwarded to the DA's office for review and possible prosecution. She is clearly out of control and you are her preferred victim. She could and should be prosecuted. She is probably planning on getting loans against your real property. You need to act!  In the alternative you can seek a civil restraining order! If the DA were to prosecute they will seek restitution for you. Elder abuse may also be an issue. Good luck. Hope this helps?

Given the information in your posting, they will be able to record an abstract of judgment lien in the county, which will secure collection of the judgment for many years, even decades to come.  Having a judgment against you can still result in an order that requires you appear in court to answer questions about your finances, to see if they can find any nonexempt assets or sources of income.  If you stop paying this credit card, try to settle it, as this is more hassle than it is worth for $1600, which many collection agencies will file a lawsuit, because you own real property (your house).

1822857,"Prior to the change in the banruptcy laws in 2005 a person could keep their car after a bankruptcy discharge by making the required monthly payments.  This was called a ""ride trhough.""    The post 2005 Bankruptcy Code takes away the ""ride through"" option.  A debtor must either redeem the car (that means pay the fair market value of the car in a lump sum) , or surrender the car to the lender or reaffirm the debt.  If the debtor does not reaffirm or redeem the vehicle but he is current with his payments the lender can still repossess the car.  Some lenders, especially Ford, were very agressive about enforcing this provision.  Even if payments were current, if the debt on the car had not been reaffirmed, then Ford and others were repossessing cars.  To reaffirm the debt on the car you will have to become current with your payments, then sign a reaffirmation agreement that says that you are keeping the car and will make all payments under the contract.    Talk to the bankruptcy department of your lender.  See if they will work with you concerning the missed payments.  They would rather get the payment stream than take the car back and have to sell it to a wholesaler for a possible loss."

1825683,"Your landlord may have violated your rights, but it is a tough question.  Just like with repairs etc., a landlord has to give 24 hours notice (the law presumes that 24 hours is enough, unless there is evidence to the contrary).  Since you provided him evidence that 24 hours was not enough, and you needed more time, he may have broken this rule.   However, when he issued you the 3 day notice, what did you do? If you ignored it totally, you are probably stuck with paying the tow costs."
1783864,"If your brother has proven irresponsible and his irresponsibility is resulting in (a) problems in providing the care your mother needs and (b) wasting her resources, you have only one option:  Guardianship.  Unless she is competent to execute new documents, in which case she can merely revoke the authorities she has given him, and give those authorities to you.  Guardianships are expensive to create (probably $3,500 to $7,500) and require ongoing legal services for the required reporting by the Guardian to the Probate Court.  Those periodic reports may add another $1,000 to $2,000 in annual cost.  And everything that happens in Probate Court is public.  If your mother does not have the resources to afford these services, you may be able to access legal services through Legal Aid, the Columbus Bar Association or the Capital University Law School clinic program."

1814688,"I'll answer your second question first -- given the facts you describe, the chances of a Quincy judge holding you on bail are near zero.   I agree with the other attorneys that you could nip this in the bud if you could raise the remaining $2,300.    Legally, larceny is the wrong charge.  Even ""failure to return leased property"" requires the government to prove intent, and frankly the payments that you made combined with your agreement at the magistrate's level all but destroys any claim of intent.  My guess is that if you are having this much trouble coming up with $2,300 you will be found indigent and given a court-appointed attorney at arraignment (if you are in fact arraigned).  By the way, rent-to-own generally costs 2-3 times as much as saving up to buy the goods outright, and the use of criminal courts to collect when there is a problem is common.  I would strongly advise against using any of these companies in the future."

One 'good thing' about your problem seems to be that but one county is involved.  Based upon my many years of professional work & interactions with people facing open warrants & 'hiding' from the law, a common thread is that such people tend to be very much on-guard 24-7, typically 'afraid of their own shadow', wary of all, constantly nervous & experiencing unending emotional stress. Also, in my years of work, when I interact with such people they tend to be fearful of trusting anyone at all:  Please know that USA law holds as a value that people are able to confer with their attorney counsel absent fear of the breach of confidentiality.  Private attorney and client communications are protected by law and by att'y rules of professional conduct fyi.     I urge you to choose a very well-experienced attorney right away, one of us who is a member of the MN State Bar Assn. Criminal Law Section. View a few att'y websites, read bios', look for the very rare entirely unsolicited comments of present & past clients. I urge you to choose an att'y who imparts to you a sense of great trustworthiness, understanding & compassion; the attorney and client relationship is an extraordinarily personal relationship.  No one here could responsibly predict outcome, but offering general odds for the fact pattern you described would definitely be reasonable. The state in which you presently reside may be a factor to the ultimate resolution.  I note to you that the odds of a person being alcoholic are very near 100 percent when one has had two DWI's.  Statistically when a person winds up with a DWI, he/she has 'gotten away' with driving drunk or otherwise impaired for 75-80 or well over 100 times prior.  I support participation in a healthy 12 Step group or other recovery program that is not fee-based.  The MainStreeters group in the Mpls. suburbs meets every day of the year in 3 locations; the MainStreeters group is held in high esteem throughout the USA & beyond.  MainStreeters is an Open AA group which means everyone - no limits - is welcomed.  Should you think you may have a 'drinking problem' or other chem' dep' or use or abuse issue, worry or concern, simply show up to group, arrive early & plan to stay late as there is 'a group b4 the group' & 'a group after the group'.  Offer to be one of the lucky ones to help clean.  I urge you pay close attention & approach one or more people of your same gender who have many years of recovery:  It is to you to ask for help.  Ask to speak 1 to 1 & in privacy.  Choose people who with years of recovery who demonstrate kindness & humility:  A good rule of thumb then is 'do as directed', not do what you think make sense.  Active alcoholics and other active addicts & drug users & abusers tend to be very, very ill people, & liars by definition.  Urge: Be wary of 'free advice'.  Best to you, & I trust you will feel tremendous relief once this matter is laid to rest & long behind you.  You can do this !!      Tricia Dwyer Esq"

What you said here is self serving (which means it probably won't hurt you later), but if you say/write the wrong thing and it gets misinterpreted, the prosecution will print it up, mark it as an evidentiary exhibit and use it against you at trial.  Even if you do not intend actually to proceed with a lawyer, you should still invest the money for a consultation because there are a lot of dynamics in play in these types of cases you may not know about, and the prosecution will take full advantage of your lack of familiarity with the law.  For instance, if you take any type of plea bargain that involves entering a straight plea of guilty, you have just given up your right to possess a firearm anywhere in the United States.  This is a big problem for Soldiers, security personnel, law enforcement, and I would suggest any woman who lives in a large city and wants to keep open the option of protecting herself from being assaulted by criminal predators.  Additionally, in many jurisdictions, threats of jail time for a minor first offense may be empty threats used as a scare tactic to get you to take a deal; or if the alleged victim is not cooperating with the prosecution and isn't showing up to court as you indicated, the court may end up dismissing the case for lack of evidence.  But the prosecution likely won't tell you that.  You need to find out about all of these things before you talk to the prosecution, and how the criminal courts work up in Denver.  Leroi, Bryans and Rosmarin (who answered your question earlier) are excellent attorneys who operate in your area.  I would suggest you contact one of them and educate yourself fully as to your options and the legal implications involved with each.  Good luck!"

That equal share is based on estimating the ongoing expenses for say 6 months, or whatever time you choose.   Then agree to have one of the three be in charge of making the payments, and keep a daily record with each party getting notice by phone or writing or email, of monies paid out.

Your best bet would be to try and reconcile with your wife's that is at all possible.  Just filing for divorce doesn't mean the divorce is final.  If reconciliation isn't possible the.

If there's a mistake, but an arrest warrant has already issued for you, you'll need to turn yourself in on the warrant (with an attorney) and have your lawyer clarify why your not involved in court.  If there's a mistake and no warrant issued, but one might be sought soon, then your attorney can provide whatever evidence or documentation exists to prove you're not involved.  The police would then have an obligation to represent the exculpatory evidence/documentation in any warrant application.  Under no circumstances should you speak/meet the police without an attorney.

1788325,"You can talk to a personal injury attorney about filing a class action lawsuit.  You could report them to the government.  The question here is if they are  making any claims that are forbidden.  Companies often make qualified claims (this claim is not evaluated by the FDA, etc) and they are not breaking the law or committing a tort.  If there is fine print, they are probably not liable. This is not to say people shouldn't try to hold companies accountable, it just makes it a little more difficult.  Maybe file a claim with the Oregon Department of Justice."

While it is highly improper for an attorney to advise he will do something (especially a time sensitive issue) and then fail to do so, you have a better chance of winning the lottery than being granted a new trial. Trial judges very rarely overturn what a jury has already decided.   Complaining to the judge verbally will probably get you no where, You need to consult with another attorney and have him/her make the argument for you.

Since you didn't take anything, obviously the video can't show that. You can always testify if you have to about your medical conditions. However, I would get a lawyer to help you with this so that all the evidence is addressed correctly."

This is especially true since you have already paid the fine, or at least believe that the matter had been resolved. If you can't afford an attorney, definitely appear in court and challenge it. Perhaps the judge will believe that you paid it and dismiss it, or perhaps the law enforcement officer who issued you the citation won't appear because he left the job or changed positions, etc."

There is a temporary spousal support award, then a possible permanent spousal support award depending on the duration of the marriage.  For starters, to give you a basic guideline for temporary spousal support, take 40% of the high wage earner's net monthly income, subtract 50% of the lower wage earner's net monthly income and this should approximately equate to temporary spousal support.  The court looks at expenses, but it really doesn't come into play much.  I hope this is helpful.  John N. Kitta Fremont"

The only way to back off a lawsuit would be to dismiss it or send signals that they are willing to settle. You want to make sure that you turn your allegations into viable counterclaims. To do so, you need to spell out the facts which you believe amount to a breach of contract or other civil wrong and articulate how you have been harmed."

Get a copy of the complaint and consult directly with a criminal defense lawyer licensed in NJ to discuss what needs to be done, before you have to be in Court. If you do not know anything about what allegedly occurred, you and your lawyer need to work out what steps need to be taken to counter the charges and develop a defense to these allegations. While it may be a set-up, the prosecutor will not understand the defense position until your lawyer and the prosecutor discuss what the State witnesses say happened, and your lawyer informs them what the defense position is."

I fail to see the point of hauling your ex back into family court."
1785437,"There are any number of reasons the ALJ might not ask hypotheticals of a VE at hearing, some good and some bad.  On the good side, if someone meets a Listing at Step 3, their RFC does not matter at all, because the ALJ never reaches questions about PRW at Step 4 or transferable skills at Step 5.  On the (possibly) bad side, if the ALJ thinks she might find an RFC that fits the Grid (i.e., a full range of sedentary work, or light work, etc.), then there is often no need to pose a hypo to the VE, because the answer is dictated by regulation.  You don't need a vocational expert to tell you that someone who can do a full range of sedentary work can do any unskilled sedentary job available.  I want to elaborate on the transferable skills thing, though - there is only a very, very small number of cases where transferable skills FROM sedentary jobs TO sedentary jobs matters to the outcome of a case.  For people under age 50, it doesn't matter.  For people over age 50, it only matters if they're found NOT able to do their old sedentary job, but ABLE to do a different sedentary job that they have transferable skills for.  This is a very rare case - I think I've had this come up once in a few hundred hearings.  I'll give an example: a 52 y/o phone salesperson (sedentary) develops a mental condition such that she cannot work with people.  That gets incorporated into her RFC, and she can't do that PRW at Step 4.  At Step 5, we determine if she fits the ""Grid.""  If she's limited to sedentary work, the Grid says she wins, even if there are sedentary jobs she can do - unless she has transferable skills to a sedentary job.  Then she loses.    Like I said, this only matters for people over 50, who can't do their old sedentary jobs, who have transferable skills to other sedentary jobs that their RFC would allow them to do.  If you're under 50, transferability doesn't matter.  If you're over 50 and the ALJ finds you can do PRW, transferability doesn't matter.  If you're over 50 and the ALJ finds you can't do any sedentary work at all, transferability doesn't matter.  Best of luck.  Please remember that we're all just giving best guesses here, and that your own representative is best placed to give you accurate and detailed answers based on your circumstances."

Get the help you need to stabilize your life. To determine if a conservatorship is necessary, an interested party (such as a family member or in some cases, your attorney) must petition the probate court, and that court (not the criminal judge) asks a doctor to examine you and make specific diagnoses.  The court does not simply rely on statements made in your criminal case.  The doctor must give the probate court the following information under ARS 14-5303. 1. A specific description of the physical, psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of the person. 2. A comprehensive assessment listing any functional impairments of the alleged incapacitated person and an explanation of how and to what extent these functional impairments may prevent that person from receiving or evaluating information in making decisions or in communicating informed decisions regarding that person. 3. An analysis of the tasks of daily living the alleged incapacitated person is capable of performing without direction or with minimal direction. 4. A list of all medications the alleged incapacitated person is receiving, the dosage of the medications and a description of the effects each medication has on the person's behavior to the best of the declarant's knowledge. 5.

Then, because there is NY property, the NJ executor will need to file for ancillary probate in NY.  This will take some time, and it would be wise to retain a lawyer who does probate in both NJ and in NY...NY is a pain, NJ is pretty easy.  There are many reasons to get this done...one of which is that the insurance company insuring the property may refuse payment if they find out that the deceased is no longer alive.  Often insurance companies will require a new application, especially for the NJ property which sounds like it would now be considered a rental property.  If there is a fire, flood or if someone gets hurt the executor might find themselves drawn into litigation.  Time to get this one done!"
1814022,"You need to ask your attorney since you are already represented by one.  (But the answer is yes, you can receive copies of a sealed court order as long as you are a party to the case.)

1818602,"I am confused on why you collected SSI, but an application was not filed for Social Security Disability Insurance. When you apply for SSI, the claims representative is supposed to determine if you are eligible for any disability program offered by Social Security. The only thing that I could determine, is that you have worked since 2008, and at the time you applied for SSI, you did not yet have enough work credits to qualify, but as of recently, you had acquired enough credits. My answer is going to be based on that assumption, and also on the assumption that your SSI benefits terminated in 2010 when you were awarded VA compensation.  So if that is the case, your new application for Social Security Disability Insurance can only pay retroactive benefits for at most 12 months prior to the date of the application. If your prior application was not reopened for any reason, then unless your current application for SSDI was filed at some point prior to January 2012, your benefits would not be reduced for SSI that you receive throughout any time in 2010 (that is because there would be no period of time that you would be receiving SSDI for, that you have already received SSI payments).  My major concern really is why you only got SSI to begin with after being discharged from the military. If it was because you worked and earned work credits to qualify for SSDI after being discharged from the military in 2008, than it is not really a concern. If you had sufficient work credits for SSDI when you previously got SSI, I would be concerned that you lost a lot of benefits that you potentially should have qualified for and you probably want to have an attorney review all the information you have received from SSA since 2008."

If you are asking whether you can travel while you are on short term disability, the answer is probably yes, but check the terms of the policy to be sure. I suggest that you not call the insurance company and ask that question, as they might decide to conduct surveillance. Rather, call them or your human resources and ask for a copy of the policy.  If you are asking whether it is legal to travel while on pain medication, the answer is different. If you will be taking narcotic pain medication, it is probably illegal to operate a vehicle while taking this medication, as it probably is considered operating a vehicle under the influence. I cannot think of a reason why having someone drive you, or taking a boat, plane, or train to travel where you are not operating the vehicle would be illegal. However, it might be wise to consult with a criminal attorney in Colorado who will know the laws there just to be sure if that is your concern."
976388,"A secret (or sealed) indictment is an indictment whose existence has not been released to the public. All proceedings before the grand jury are done in secret. When the District Attorney (in Massachusetts) presents a case to the grand jury the DA presents the Grand Jury with a letter. The letter is called a bill. The bill is a written request that the grand jury charge a specific person with a crime. If the DA is not certain who the person is they present a ""John Doe"" letter. If the grand jury votes to charge the person the grand jury marks the bill as a ""true bill"". A ""true bill"" is an indictment. If the Grand Jury votes not to charge the person the grand jury marks the bill as a ""no bill"". The ""true bills"" or indictments are then delivered by the Grand Jury to the presiding judge in the Superior Court. This is done in open court and the foreperson of the grand jury literally hands the true bills (and the no bills) to the Judge. It is at this point that the District Attorney can ask that a ""true bill"" (indictment) be sealed or impounded so that the public will not have access to it or be made aware of its existence. That is typically done when the DA fears that a person will flee if they are made aware that an indictment has been filed against them. Your nephew is in jail so it is not likely that he will flee anywhere. The grand jury may absolutely rely on the word of two people who were involved - or even one person who was involved.

1815238,"Let me get this straight.  You're a mistress of a married man and he pays you $4,000 to $6,000 per month.  You would like to call this a gift.  An individual can gift you up to $14,000 per year with no reporting requirement on the donor.  If he gives you more than that amount, he must report it.  The real question you must ask yourself is whether the married man would give you $4,000 to $6,000 per month if he was not getting sex in exchange for the money.  If the answer is ""no,"" you're being paid for services rendered, and it is highly likely that the IRS and FTB will view these payments as earned income and fully taxable as such.  The use of paypal or any other mechanism to avoid taxes is fraud and there is no statute of limitations on fraud and the penalties can be substantial.  Accordingly, I would highly recommend that you consult with a tax attorney at your earliest convenience."

951580,"If the judge did not continue the discovery cutoff with he or she continued the trial date you are likely well past the discovery motion cutoff.  That date was 15 days before the first date set for trial.  Unless expressly continued, it remains the same date regardless of the trial date moving.  The only way you can now bring a discovery motion is to first get court permission to file it by way of an ex parte application to extend the discovery cutoff for purposes of your motion.  If granted, you can then bring the motion.  If not, you are left with another option.  If it is a party you wish to get the document from, you can timely serve a demand under CCP 1987 for the production of the document at trial.  You need to reasonably particularize the document rather than asking for a broad category as you would in discovery.  On the first day of trial you can raise the issue of your demand with the judge and he or she will order the document produced to the clerk.  You can then look at it.  If the document resides in the possession of a non-party you can subpoena the records to trial.   Good luck to you."

2361333,"If your intention is to drop it entirely, then it probably makes sense to file the DBA.   I would really just add that merely registering a business with the state or county conveys no right to use that name as a trademark in commerce. The states are really just concerned that no other business name is being registered with the exact same as another already on file. This is not a trademark analysis of course. For example, I could probably register the name of my new tech start up ""Boogle"" in the state of TX because presumably there is no other business already registered there with that same name. But this does not mean that I am not infringing on the Google trademark which I mostly would be.   Your trademark will be one of if not the most important and valuable business assets you will have and you will ultimately spend more money in support if it than you will anywhere else (advertising, marketing, PR, branding, packaging, etc.). So you owe it to your business and yourself to make sure you handle this properly upfront and the first order of business always starts with a proper and comprehensive clearance.   Whenever you endeavor into investing in a trademark it is very important that you conduct the proper clearance due diligence upfront and before you start spending any money in support of it or submit an application to the USPTO. In the US, this means searching under both federal (USPTO) as well as common law because trademark rights stem from use in this country NOT registration. This means that acquiring a federal registration does not necessarily mean that you are not infringing on another's intellectual property. See the link below for a brief article from Fox Business News on the importance of the due diligence process and our overview guide.   I suggest that you consult with a lawyer in private and discuss your objectives in more detail. You can start by calling around to several for a free phone consultation, get some insights then pick the best fit to work with.   Best regards,  Frank  Natoli-Lapin, LLC"
1801653,"Dear NYC Tenant:  Of course it is not legal to maintain a building anywhere in New York City in a slum-like condition. The New York State Multiple Dwelling Law requires an owner maintain a building in good condition at all times. So does the NYC Housing Maintenance Code. Any tenant in NYC may make a complaint about building conditions by a call to 311.  You cannot take care of the leaks for the last few years, but you can tale of the leaks now. NYC tenants may sue landlords for repairs in the NYC Housing Court.  Look at: http://www.courts.state.ny.us/COURTS/nyc/housing/startinghp.shtml  But what is the point? You are not a rent regulated tenant, and your landlord does not need a reason to choose to refuse a renewal lease. When this lease is up, you will need to move. You are legally free to move at the end of the lease. Since this is not a new event ( as you say ""for years') what kept you living in deplorable conditions was your decision not to move out the last time your lease expired?  Old law tenement buildings may have antique utility services ( but is there a real difference with the gas meter in the kitchen or bathroom?) and so, unless there is a code violation or the condition is inherently hazardous, why now be concerned after all the years you lived with the gas meter in the bathroom?"

Both the probate and chancery courts in Davidson County handle name changes.  The form for a name change is on the circuit court clerk's website (under probate court - forms) and on the chancery court's website. There is a court fee imposed.  One should file the form and pay the required fee at the appropriate court clerk's office. One must appear in court to request the name change and to assure the Court that the change of name is not to avoid criminal prosecution, to evade creditors, or for any other improper purpose.

2350385,"I can;t answer your question base on ""hate crime"" and you should not be putting your personal (case) information online.  Strill, as you did I looked and you were convicted of felony battery.  A conviction, for anything, not onyl cannot be sealed / expunged but it precludes you ability to seal or expunge anything else, ever.  Still, following is everything that you want / need to know about the subject...  Sealing is available in a case where you received a withhold of adjudication, and expunction is available in a case which was dismissed, nolle pros'd, no actioned or where you were found to have been not guilty. In Florida you can only seal or expunge one eligible (non-disqualified) offense in your lifetime.   If you look at the following website you will learn everything you ever wanted to know about the sealing / expunction process:   http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/content/getdoc/c83dd888-ef7a-448e-9a96-ba69fc4181f7/Seal-and-Expunge-Home.aspx   I also strongly encourage you to both read my AVVO Legal Guide on Sealing and Expunging Records in FL and watch my YouTube Webisode on Sealing / Expnging records as they both contain valuable information supplemental to this answer and should prove to be helpful to you.  For your convenience the both links follow and are attached at the bottom of this answer:  Please see:  http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/sealing-and-expunging-records-in-fl-a-legal-guide-by-michael-a-haber-esq-miami-criminal-lawyer?published=true  Please see: https://youtu.be/XtndMiwCP84  The procedure is both quite detailed and somewhat painstaking but is also far from being rocket science. You can attempt to navigate it yourself (FDLE has tried to simplify it - again I refer you to the website above) but, assuming your eligibility, any criminal defense lawyer (anywhere in Florida - this can be done remotely and does not necessarily require a local attorney, although a local attorney may or may not be less expensive) will be able to accomplish the task with greater ease and likely in a shorter time period.   That said I suspect that it doesn't much matter where you were arrested, what you were arrested for, what the final disposition was or whether or not you sealed / expunged the record. This is 2015 and we are forehead deep into the internet age, where nothing is private, sacred or truly hidden from public scrutiny.   Sadly, sealing (and expunging) only applies to certain (not even to all) government agencies (for example if fingerprints, mugshots, DNA or anything else - including crime statistics bearing your name or identifying information - were uplaoded to the FBI database then a local Order of Expunction would not effect the Feds) and that it has no effect whatsoever on private (er, extortionist) enterprise, who compile and maintain arrest information and then demand that you pay them off to remove your information from their database and public access. Worse still, after you ""buy back your information"", then you can count on there being another private company lurking, somewhere, sometime, somehow, just waiting for you to pay them off as well. Its a seemingly never-ending vicious cycle.   For better or for worse you are probably best advised to take the wind out of the sails by admitting your past issues / indiscretions to your present (or potential) employer, lender, landlord, etcetera, rather than waiting for them to find out on their own.   I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."

Another good non-litigation option which would allow you to do this is the Collaborative Practice approach.  This is different from (and often preferable to ) Mediation, because in Collaborative practice, each party has his/her own attorney from the outset to represent his/her interests.    Each attorney has been trained in the Collaborative approach, which emphasizes cooperation rather than unnecessary conflict, full disclosure and the exchange of all necessary documentation on an informal expedited basis rather than ""formal discovery procedures"" which takes a lot longer and cost each client a lot more money. If you want to learn more about the Collaborative approach, you can access the website of the New Jersey Collaborative Law Group, which is www.newjerseycollaborativelawgroup.com.    I believe that you should meet as soon as possible with a very experienced lawyer who devotes his/her entire practice to New Jersey Divorce and Family Law matters and is trained not only in the litigation approach, but also in Mediation and the Collaborative Practice approach.        Go over your situation in detail with the attorney, get educated answers to your questions, and obtain expert guidance as to the best course of action. In my opinion, it will be well worth the cost of the meeting."

1882956,"There is no cap on the amount you can demand from the insurance company.  However, it is highly unlikely that you will have a productive mediation if you make a demand that is outrageous, and doesn't tempt the insurance carrier to negotiate.  Also, you don't want to sell yourself short and demand an amount that is below the value of your case.   The value of a workers' compensation case is based upon the Carrier's exposure (i.e., worst case monetary scenario) in providing you benefits.  If you are unrepresented, you certainly would need a qualified workers' compensation attorney to assist you in determining what the Carrier's exposure is on your claim."

1823823,"People can be downright ridiculous sometimes and it sounds like your ex-husband is exhibiting child-like mean behavior that is likely a result of his own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy.  Nevertheless, I am sure it is exhausting and feels terrible to read nasty emails from someone you once loved and respected enough to have children with and marry.    You might be able to get a temporary restraining order but unless he is threatening harm you wont likely be able to get anything permanent.  You also probably want to consider the costs and hassle of legal action before pursuing the same, but you likely are already aware of those if you have battled this man for years.  Unless you have endless resources - time, money, and energy, cause as I am sure you know you often need all three when pursuing legal action, legal action might not be the route to take.      The easy solution might be changing your email address and not giving him the new email address.  Alternatively, if you dont want to change your email address, you could also filter his mail into a junk folder and only look at it when you feel like you can deal with it with a clear head and not let it influence how you feel about yourself.    One good side of this, it there is a record of what he is doing.  He is actually making it for you by writing everything down.  Make sure to very clearly and shortly telling him you do not appreciate what he is doing and you want it to stop.  Do it in writing so he knows you want his behavior to stop.  Dont engage in it or respond by defending yourself, simply tell him, in a written response, you dont want him to continue to write you emails like this, you dont want him to bad mouth you to your children (because you dont bad mouth him to your children) and that you will not continue to respond to his emails if they continue to be mean.  Thereafter, stop responding if the emails continue to be mean.    Also, print out the emails and keep them in a folder somewhere safe just in case you ever need them to use in court or anywhere else.  If the language gets abusive or threatening get a restraining order immediately.  In most cases you can initially do this yourself without getting an attorney just by going to the courthouse and asking for help at the self-help center.  The first step is often a temporary order which you then have to renew.    As far as your children go, maybe explain to them that daddy is mad at mommy right now and it has nothing to do with them and tell them they dont need to respond when he says bad things about you to them.  If it is very upsetting to the children or to you, it might not be a bad idea to seek out a professional psychologist to speak with and work through it all.    Good luck, and I hope your ex-husband stops this behavior promptly."
1790107,"You seem to misunderstand the state of things in Florida.  I agree with you that the reasoning in the Bartram case is wrong.  Did you see the recent Evergrene Partners case from the 4th DCA which adopts the wrong reasoning from Bartram ?    It is pretty obvious that many of the courts of Florida are committed to preclude consumers from benefitting from the dysfunction of the mortgage industry.  The Pino case is one that never should have been appealed, and the wrong result there was inevitable.   As soon as the Supreme Court of Florida announced that it was going to hear the case even though the parties didn't want it to, the handwriting was on the wall.  I am unclear what you mean by ""business as usual"" however.  When people appeal the wrong cases, they leave the door open for courts to write opinions like Pino.  I agree with you that it is wrong to conclude as the courts did in Bartram and Evergrene, that the acceleration is meaningless.  Many of the attorneys who purport to defend foreclosure cases should not be taking them, do not really understand the issues and potential issues in depth, and are inadequately complacent concerning those judges who are failing to follow the law. and accept a lack of due process afforded to foreclosure defendants.  There are many difficult and complex issues relating to proper defense of these cases, made all the more difficult by the attitude of many of the courts and then further compounded by shoddy defense practices in many instances, which help to convince the judges that defense is typically frivolous.  While there are usually legitimate and valid defenses that can and should be raised, that is often not the case.  We often see people who hired a different law firm initially, and once these people realize the 'defense' firm did not defend them, they come to us.  I am greatly troubled at what I often see was not done when we review these files.."

1810265,"Very good question.  First, although I completely agree with you that the decision is wrong and should be reversed, it isn't clear that the case will be reversed.  The Florida Supreme Court first has to agree to accept jurisdiction of the case (which it likely will) and then it needs to accept briefs, hear oral argument and rule on the case.  Your guess as to how long this process will take is as good as mine, but my best guess is that there will be some type of opinion in the second half of 2015.   I handle a lot of quiet title cases and foreclosure matters where I have raised the statute of limitations as a defense, and like you am anxiously awaiting a definitive answer on this question.  I have authored articles where I have made my position clear, which is completely opposite of the Court's opinion in the Bartram matter.  I look forward to the Florida Supreme Court accepting jurisdiction of this matter and hopefully ruling in the way that I believe they should."

If the house is a single family house on the C of O, then the basement apartment is not legal or safe for that matter, and a landlord of an illegal dwelling is not entitled to use the court system to collect unpaid rent.  If you are giving up on the person illegally renting a room from your mother in her apartment, end the month to month tenancy. In NYC the termination notice is written and served in the same manner as a lawsuit in Housing Court. And, likely, because your mother waited until no time was left to serve a proper notice this month to end the tenancy on August 31, the notice when served in August cannot end the monthly tenancy before September 31, 2014. The police were involved likely because your mother committed some act that could be viewed as violating a NYC local law (this is a criminal act) prohibiting conduct to evict a tenant without a court proceeding. A tenant of an illegal apartment (or a room in an illegal apartment) has no legal obligation to pay rent."

This is the time and place where final negotiations take place between the parties. A case can be dismissed at the pretrial conference, but there would have to be good grounds for doing so. Usually cases are dismissed after a successful motion. There is always hope for resolution (either a plea or dismissal) after the Pretrial Conference.

To answer this question, an attorney will order with your authorization medical records from the circumcision 3 years ago, and the revision surgery records, and pediatric records as needed.  Another question will be whether the revision surgery is successful.  If it is, then the question will be whether there has been any permanent damage and whether the case would be economically viable for you."

While there are very good public defenders, there are a lot of them that do not have the time to give the proper time that this case is going to need in order to avoid a conviction and/or jail time.

Besides, unless I am the only criminal attorney with clients who did not have a rainy day criminal defense attorney slush fund, none of our clients have money. This is not the area of law with wealthy clients, generally speaking. So, I tell you all of this because unless you have spoken with  numerous attorneys, you really do not know whether or not an attorney will work with you on fees that you might be able to come up with. Look into that before you settle for a public defender just because you ""can't afford"" a private attorney.   At the end of the day, if you cannot afford a decent private attorney, then you can always petition the court to give you a court appointed lawyer, or public defender. But I would use this as a last resort option before I did that..."

1872035,"Short answer, you will not be eligible for an expunction in Florida if you received a withhold of adjudication on a felony charge. As for whether your VOP will be dismissed, you mentioned subsequent thefts. I take it you were re-arrested while on probation for two additional thefts. I would be shocked if a judge dismissed a violation of probation based upon two new law violations (the same type of offense mind you - thefts) because you went to bible study, etc. Entering into bible study is not a defense to the new charges, nor is it a defense to a violation of probation. That being said, I am not telling you that no valid defense exists to any of the charges you are facing. Perhaps there is a defense to all of them. I wouldn't know, nor would anyone on this website, without having reviewed the entire case files for each accusation. An attorney would go over your case with a fine-toothed comb looking for defenses, technical or otherwise. Violating felony probation with new law violations based on the same or similar-type charge is treated very seriously by a judge. I think you need to take this seriously as you may very will be facing incarceration. Forget an expungement unless you were somehow able to ""undo"" the original grand theft and get that dismissed, and also get the two new theft charges dismissed, and also not have any prior criminal history. Your focus should not be on expungement but staying out of jail or prison at this point."

If the break is more than six months but less than one year, the applicant may overcome that presumption by showing unbroken ties to the U,S, such as employment, family, and unimpeded access to abode in the U.S.. If the absence is of more than one year, it will disrupt continuous residence, except for certain cases involving employment with the U.S. government or certain private institutions. In case of such break of more than one year, the applicant wishing to preserve continuous residence needs to file form N-470. No other travel document will preserve continuous residence for purposes of naturalization. The possibility of abandoning residence also needs to be considered but is separate and different. There can be disrution of continuous residence even if there is no abandonment of residence.  Apart from the continuous residence requirement, there is, of course the pysical presence requirement of thirty or eighteen months, depending on whether the applicant qualifies for five or three year naturalization.  A person who is denied naturalization because of disruption of continuous residence may reapply for naturalization four years after re-establishing residence in cases where five years are required, or two years when three are required.

1813345,"While you and your grandmother may agree that it's time to move to unsupervised visitation, a Judge always decides if and when an order should be modified.  I do understand your confusion.  Usually when DCS opens a case like this, there are a few things going on.    First there is usually a CPS (Child Protective Services division of DCS)case where allegations of dependency and neglect are investigated.  If they are found and CPS believe they are serious enough to need a Court Order to change custody, an immediate change of custody may occur and an action will be filed in the appropriate court to sustain this.  At this point in time, the court will have control over all matters of custody and visitation, and this control will not change until another court is required to take control of the case for some reason or the child turns 18.  After the child has been placed in a home by the court, DCS may also keep an administrative case open (with a case manager called a Family Support Worker) to assist the family with transition and to help address the problems that led to court and DCS involvement.  If the legal custody of the child is placed with a relative, the administrative side moves very fast and is usually quickly closed since DCS isn't always able to pay and spend time to move a child around within the child's family.  (There are statutes and rules that govern this process).    However, the closing of a DCS case does not suspend the previous orders in effect from Court.  Whether DCS has an administrative case open has little-to-no impact on what is required under the Court's order's.  Always follow the current Court Order, regardless of what happened to DCS.  To reiterate, a Judge always decides when a visitation order can and should be modified.  Don't start thinking there are shortcuts to this!   You should contact an attorney in your area to discuss filing necessary pleadings to modify the Court's visitation requirements.  If your grandmother is in agreement with a reasonable proposal, it could be a great success story for you and your family.  Good luck!"

The sticky point is getting service of process on the other partner to the marriage, and that is where Hague comes in.  Over 20 years ago, and before Hague, I handled a case where the husband was an American contractor in Viet Nam during the conflict, married a Vietnamese woman according to the domestic law of Viet Nam, returned with him to the US as a part of the last-minute evacuation, and then decided she wanted to return, and did.  We filed the case here, obtained personal service of process using the graces of the Swiss Embassy and resolved the issues.  It was important because the parties had a child who stayed here with the father.  All this is to say it can be done, but it takes time and thorough attention to the issue of jurisdiction."

First, if you are charged with anything,  you have a Constitutional right to have an attorney appointed to you at taxpayer expense.  But that won't be until you are actually embroiled in a prosecution.  For the moment, you should still consult with someone in a private confidential setting.  Many attorneys will offer low-cost or free consultations.  Nothing you say to your attorney can be used against you.  Even in the setting of a free consultation, the attorney will be ethically bound to keep all your secrets.  That's why you confine all your conversations to confidential settings.  As for how long the government may keep your things.  Unfortunately, the answer to that is that they may keep it for a ""reasonable"" period of time under the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  What's reasonable?  Who knows?  You have to come up with arguments, from the case law I know, many years can be deemed reasonable depending on the facts of the case.

If you haven't already, document each time they contact you and make notes of what they say. If you'd rather not answer the phone then just document the date and time of the phone call. Gather up any letters or paperwork you've obtained from them and then make an appointment to see a consumer protection attorney.

1804579,"I expect you have a social worker helping you through the pregnancy. She will be able to help you. What assistance you can get does depend on your status.  California has rules that use an old court-based idea called PRUCOL - permanent resident under color of law - to decide who is eligible for med--cal. It is not always obvious or what you would expect. The only way your husband would be charged for anything (since he is not here now) is that if you are both living in california, your marital ""community"" shares debts. So if you have a debt, he would share it with you. You may be thinking of affidavits of support and other immigration issues - and that is about the immigrant becoming a public charge, and the government wanting a way of being reimbursed if that happens. Good luck. Get the medical help you need, and ask your social worker about the assistance that is available to you."
1792030,"I normally recommend that most people that are applying for Social Security should obtain an attorney to help them with the process. The Social Security Disability process is difficult, and part of what an attorney can do is advise you of the requirements of the program. My concern is that you say that you are at the fourth tier of the Social Security Disability process, if this means that you have already been denied by an Administrative Law Judge, even with the help of an attorney, it will be very difficult to be approved for benefits.  Social Security allows claims to be reviewed de novo at the initial application stage, reconsideration and at the Administrative Law Judge Hearing stage. This means that at each of these stages, the person deciding your claim can disregard the prior denials. They do not have to explain why it was wrong that you were previously denied. At the Appeals Council stage (the normal fourth step), Appeals Council can only determine if the Administrative Law Judge had substantial evidence to support the conclusion that was made. This means that even if Appeals Council would have made a different decision, if there is any support in the record for the conclusion the ALJ made, and the ALJ did a good job of documenting why the particular decision was made, Appeals Council cannot reverse the ALJ decision.   Typically, new evidence is not considered at the Appeals Council level. This means that if now an attorney can get an opinion from your doctors that you were disabled, if this same opinion could have been obtained prior to the hearing, it would not be considered when Appeals Council reviews your claim. Appeals Council is normally stuck with just the same evidence the ALJ had to rely on when the decision was made. (The rare exception is when Appeals Council determines evidence is new and material).  If someone contacts me after they have been denied at the ALJ level, it is normally very difficult to do anything to help. I consistently find that when the ALJ issued the decision, the potential client had not obtained supportive medical evidence, and there a very few medical opinions in their file. This is why it is important that you obtain an attorney at the earliest point possible (even before you apply). When I represent someone at an ALJ hearing, I do everything possible to get the most supportive evidence in the file before the hearing. This allows me to rely on this evidence even during an Appeals Council Appeal.  I would highly recommend that you contact an attorney immediately to discuss these issues. It is also important to note that if you are under the age of 50, it really doesn't matter that you cannot perform work you have performed in the past. When you are under 50, even if it is determined that you cannot perform your past work, you must still prove that your condition is severe enough to prevent you from performing all full-time work.  Even if you have a statement from one of your doctors indicating that you are disabled, these statements have little value in a Social Security proceeding. Disabled is a legal term in Social Security Disability Law. The finding of being disabled is reserved for Social Security. A conclusion from your doctor that you are disabled, has no meaning unless the doctor explains what that means. For example, for a physical condition, your doctor needs to explain how you are limited in sitting, standing, walking, lifting, bending, crouching, using your arms, using your legs, and concentrating. There should be a detailed explanation of these limitations, with references to the diagnosis that causes the limitations, and citation to test results that show the condition exists.   If you have not yet contacted an attorney, I would suggest that you do so immediately. Please remember that you usually only have 60 days from the date of the decision to file an appeal, if you have not yet appealed your decision, you will probably want to do so as soon as possible."
1796481,"It's closer to a scam than anything else I've ever encountered under the law.  Unfortunately, major retailers have forced through state legislatures these ""civil demand"" laws.

The judge will then set a new date to continue monitoring your progress."
1816356,"Yes.  They can rely on mistakes of fact (thinking your brake lights are malfunctioning when they are not).  They are not allowed to rely on mistakes of law (example: thinking your registration is incorrectly displayed when it is actually legally posted) and such a case would be thrown out.  You should talk with an attorney about the stop, and consider challenging the stop.  Officers generally are found credible if they testify that they believed something, but you may be able to challenge his assertions by presenting your own evidence that his stop was unreasonable under the circumstances.  For example, some stops are recorded by a patrol car video camera and you can request a copy of that video footage (not true in all cases).  Find a local attorney and request a consultation to discuss the options for challenging the police action."

As soon as you say ""that person caused me harm,"" the defendant gets to explore all potential factors that could have caused the harm.  Here, since this is potentially a STD, the defendant will be able to explore the other avenues that might have caused  the disease.  This can feel quite invasive.  It might include a review of your medical records as well as a physical exam.  It may also include deposition testimony from your former partners.  The good new,is that you do not have to prove absolutely that the scissors were the cause.  All you have to prove is that the waxing center""s acts or omissions were more likely than not a substantial factor in causing your condition.  More likely than not simply means greater than 50% probability and substantial factor more or less means something that is not trivial or remote.  It would be an uncomfortable case for you to pursue, but you may have a good chance of success. Thank you for posting your question.  Best of luck to you."

While there may be a fine line between interfering with the father's custodial time and having the children participate in beneficial activities that they enjoy and that will help them, it seems like you are describing an unreasonable parent. If what you are describing is actually accurate, you are basically saying that dad is refusing to allow his 13 and 15 year old to attend day camps during his visitation time even though he is at work and it won't take any time away from him. What is his reason for not letting them attend? Do the children want to attend? If the children want to attend and he does not have a good reason  to not allow them to attend, then you need to ""put your foot down"" and state the the children will attend. This usually can be done either through your attorney or by a conference with judge in your case."

In order to make an S election you would have to file a 2553 form with the IRS within 90 days of formation.  There are a lot of reasons why the S election is not good.

So be sure that you are in a place that actually is treated, in First Amendment terms, as a traditional public forum property.  In a case in which i served as co-counsel at the US Supreme Court, US v.

1792674,"Florida has 20 different Judicial Circuits, each of which deals with cases in its own manner. Moreover, each of those Judicial Circuits has a given number of criminal court Judges (each of whom is unique), as well as its own State Attorney's Office (each of which has its own policies and procedures), and a bunch of Assistant State Attorneys (who, although they operate on guidelines as established by their office, are each sentient and independent persons), and each case has its own set of variables (""free radicals"" if you will) all of which combine to make it impossible to predict what will happen in a given case.   Not knowing anything (other than your proffer) about the relevant issues in your husband's case (i.e. the facts and circumstances of the case, of your husband himself, your family, the Assistant State Attorney and his Judge) I cannot offer you ""realistic"" advise or odds, but I can say that his original charges were serious, he faced a lot of time then and now, possession of a firearm (""possession"" is loosely defined) is quick VOP (standard condition of probation ""(m)(1)"" is plain as day - for your convenience I have attached a link to the standard conditions of probation below) and that none of that looks good for him.

While that is far from any sort of guarantee of freedom it is also precisely what criminal defense attorneys deal with on a regular basis (if it were pretty then it wouldn't be criminal defense litigation).  In this case you have already hired a lawyer (presumably one who knows the facts and circumstances of the case, of your husband, your family, the Assistant State Attorney and hopefully the Judge), and s/he is the only person to whom you should turn and upon whom you should rely.

1796301,"Dear Brooklyn Tenant:  If the apartment is Rent Stabilized, the landlord is under compulsion of law to offer a lease renewal to a tenant every cycle where the current lease is ready to end and to do so within a confined period beginning 150 days before the current lease expires and not less than 90 days before the lease comes to an end. If the tenant always chooses a one year lease, then the tenant faces for the next year of tenancy the legal rate of increase allowed for a one year lease. Usually, choosing a two year lease renewal moderates the rent over the term of the two year period, but does lock the tenant in for a two year lease when the tenant desires the ability to pack and move afforded by the shorter one year lease. But over time (five as you pointed out) successive one year lease renewals would increase the rent faster than taking a lease two years at a time.  Landlords should not skip the legal obligation to offer the renewal lease because there are penalties should a tenant challenge the landlord for failing to offer a renewal lease. There is no true process for a landlord to offer a renewal lease without providing for the rates for a rent increase for a one year lease or a two year lease. The landlord must register the new rent to maintain the trail of rent over time (the ""Rent History"") and comply with the process for rent registration. A landlord may offer a tenant a preferential rent (that is a rent lower than the legal rent) and if offered and accepted, the preferential rent does not reduce the legal rent and does not carry over to the next renewal lease unless specifically provided in the preferential lease rider.   If you are concerned whether your written documents (leases, riders and renewal leases) are ""normal"" gather your papers together and consult with an attorney."

I'm also guessing that a trial date has been set so that means that for a new attorney to get involved they would have to avow to the court  that they could be ready for trial by that trial date which I'm guessing isn't too far in the future. I point this out to emphasize how important it would be for you to contact an attorney  ASAP  because the longer you wait the more difficult it will be for another attorney to get involved."

1820078,"The issues your addressed aren't things you can do anything about.  She is just a bad property manager.  It becomes a legal issue when you start presenting concerns to her related to safety and habitability of your unit or the complex as a whole.  If you inform her of leaks, broken hand rails on stair cases, repairs needed to be done in your unit, etc. and she does nothing about it, then you might have a case.  Hopefully this helps and sorry to hear you have such a lazy manager in your building."
1797227,"Exhibit lists just include the actual exhibits, documentary or physical, that you hope to introduce at trial.  Putting them on the list does not assure that the court will accept them as exhibits, it just allows you to attempt to introduce them.  You still have to actually get them introduced per the rules of evidence after authenticating them, laying appropriate foundations, moving to have them entered, and countering any objections by the other side.  Ideally you would sit down with opposing counsel prior to trial and identify what exhibits you would agree could be entered with no objections.  I'm guessing you may have some questions about the procedure I just described.  If this procedure is news to you, you need to get an attorney."
2314877,"Hello,  All of these questions should have been adequately addressed by your employer's attorney, the one who prepared and filed the I-140 on your and your employer's behalf.  In case your employer filed the I-140 without the professional help of an experienced business immigration lawyer (which is a scary thought), here are the answers you are looking for: 1.  Within a week to 10 days after USCIS having received the I-140 ""package"" at the ""Service Center"", a case filing ""receipt"" will be issued, namely a Form I-797 ""Notice of Action"", which will also include a distinct case number, which can be used for tracking and all inquiries.  Note that I-140's take approximately (""give or take"") 4-6 months to be processed and the ""trajectory"" of the case can be followed by registering for email updates at www.uscis.gov.   2.  Your employer can check with his online banking statement whether the fee payment check has been cashed or not. Usually USCIS ""cashes"" that fee check within a week (7 days) from package arrival at the Service Center.  Should the fee be wrong, not enough or even too much, the entire package will be returned within 2-3 weeks, with instructions to place that Rejection Notice (which will already have the case number) on top and include the correct fee. Hopefully the employer has sent the ""I-140 package"" via Courier, such as FedEx for instance, and requested ""confirmation"" via ""hard (albeit ""indirect"") signature. """
1793115,You may want to let this sleeping dog lay. but be prepared to handle it if it comes up in the future. I once had a client ordered to one weekend in jail that he never served as he went to report to the jail and the jail told him he was not on the list and to go home. It never came up again.
1825821,"Have any of the other units been infected? Have you traveled at all since your December move in date? Your best argument would be for you to be able to show that the bed bugs were in the apartment when you moved in, you have done nothing that might have re-infected the premises, and all previous attempts at extermination have failed. Thus, if you refuse to pay and the landlord then turns around and sues you or attempts to evict you, these are the questions and defense you will likely need to address. At that point, you should probably consult with a Los Angeles Landlord/Tenant attorney."
1789932,Not clear what you are asking nor what you are charged with.  Possession of a forged instrument (check/credit card/whatever) does not seem like an offense worthy of that convoluted defense.  Unless you're alleging extortion.
1664376,"I agree with Mr. Rafter. Your post does not set out a violation of civil rights. Instead it sounds like the school misinterpreted or overreacted to your child's ""side effects"" which I assume may have been agitation or acting out, something like that.

If your child has a diagnosis, maybe there is a nonprofit organization that can provide some kind of outreach to your child's school about whatever the issue may be."

Best of luck"
1802355,"It may seem incredulous, but you can only sue the government for things that the government says you can.  Because the cause of action of wrongful termination in violation of public policy is a common law tort, there is no statutory grant allowing it against a government entity.  Thus, the rule.  The only way for that to change is legislation.  Talk to your Representative or Senator.  Good luck to you."

If you insist on proceeding pro se (representing yourself), then respond in writing and file  the response with the Clerk of the Circuit Court prior to the response deadline. Deny those facts which have been alleged that are untrue. Additionally, make sure you send a copy of your response to opposing counsel and file a proof of service swearing you served it properly. As to whether exhibits should be attached or presented in Court, that is the attorney's preference.   I again implore you to hire an attorney to fight this battle for your home.

1818354,"As stated by Mr. Salcido, the terms of your agreement govern, insofar as they comport with the ethical rules of the Utah State Bar.  Hypothetically, if your attorney withdrew from your case and was not fairly compensated for work performed up to that point, he likely has a lien against your case. That does not mean, however, that he is entitled to 35% of the settlement. It means he is entitled UP to 35% of the settlement. He must show documented hours and costs put forward in your case, and charge a reasonable amount for those hours (the amount should be detailed in your agreement). It may be that you owe him for #X hours of documented work at $XXX.00 dollars per hour up to 35% value of your recovery. Hence, if he withdrew early, or cannot show substantial work, and the recovery is substantial, your attorney is likely owed less than that 35%. Do not, however, take the stance that you owe him nothing. He should be fairly compensated for work he can show he did on your behalf."

1820820,"Your response was definitely wise. I wish everyone in such situations immediately would request an attorney and then shut their mouths. The state may mention the attorney request, but it won't be damaging evidence. You have every right to ask for an attorney. The effect of doing so is that you cut off the potential source of more evidence against you, which obviously can only help you."
1805437,"Your only option, if I understand the facts correctly is to process the hopefully soon to be approved I-130, assuming you filed two of them, one for each person, through the US consulate.

It is an odd problem but I would possibly either mention it at your next hearing or file a motion to strike whatever she filed (motions) and state as a basis to strike that she did not actually mail the motion to you, and ask for a hearing on your motion and ask as a remedy that all future motions she be ordered to be sent certified.

The parent who owes more pays the other the difference. 3) Where the nonresidential parent spends more than 1/3 of the time but less than 50% of the time with the child, the average of calculation one and calculation two are taken.  When a parent spends SIGNIFICANTLY less than 1/3 of the time with a child, a judge is given discretion to deviate.  When a parent has EXTRAORDINARY expenses associated with travel to see the child, a judge is given discretion to deviate.  There aren't hard and fast or black and white rules about how the deviation is calculated, nor when it is warranted.  What is weighed most heavily is the best interests of the child and how to minimize the financial impact of his/her parents' maintaining separate households for the child."

1791112,"You need a lawyer to help you with this in court.  It's a felony charge, and that means you are facing the possibility of prison.  A lawyer will be able to help you take an objective look at your case and either fight the charge or help you minimize the damage.    If you are in fact guilty (and don't say anything about that in a public forum like this), you should also start saving up to pay back the $2,200 quickly.  Sometimes repayment of the lost money before it is actually required of you helps persuade a prosecutor to go easy on you during plea negotiations."
1808234,"When your employment with A terminates, you are immediately out of status and you may not re-enter US with the original O1.  Your new employer, Company B, must file a new I-129 Petition for you first, to transfer your O1 visa to them. Once the transfer is approved, you will receive a new approval notice for Company B.  You may then travel out of the country. I do not recommend that you travel before your O1 is fully transferred to the new employer. I would not do any travel during the pendency of the transfer period between companies (remember, you can file for the transfer EXPEDITED [15 business days] by using Form I-907 together with the usual I-129 for the visa transfer [called Request for Premium Processing] and paying the extra $1225 USCIS fee, but it's worth it)."

1807313,"These questions are very common, and I urge your boyfriend to go to speak with an attorney in the area to make sure that he is not going against the law by dating a 16 year old. If anything though you should be very careful of an older person preying on a younger person. Just because the law says its right or wrong doesn't always mean that there is a ""green light"". Similar with legal marijuana in Colorado doesn't mean that everyone should just go and start smoking pot. The laws are there to protect people as much as possible while still allowing people to be free to choose what they want. Think about it, speak about it, and best of all, be safe. Good luck to you."

1810726,"This may sound cliche but is true. In my view, the only option is to seek qualified, experienced counsel to defend and advocate for you. Only an attorney who represents you and who is familiar with all of the circumstances can identify and explain the various options.

1794605,"Your narrative is quite confusing and you must calm down.  You were arrested for a felony but the DA may have overcharged.  A good lawyer can hear the facts and see if there are holes to run through.  A dismissal may be possible because of the search or the chain of evidence.

1815456,"Since OWI is a crime, you should definitely consult with an attorney about this situation.  .08 is not terribly high, but there is a lesser offense called Impaired Driving that has no lower limit.  An attorney can review the police report and the videos from the police car, and evaluate your chances of beating the case, or at least getting a very advantageous plea agreement.  Beyond that, there is the matter of standing in front of a judge for sentencing, if you are convicted of an offense.  An attorney can help you prepare to be seen in the best possible light at sentencing.  Drinking and driving convictions stay on your driving record for the rest of your life, so don't be short-sighted; look at this situation long-term.  Get a lawyer.  Sincerely,  Frank B. Ford"

1811614,"I don't know of anything in the Bankruptcy Code that prohibits you from starting a business in chapter 13, except you should request court authorization both to start a business and to apply for financing, if you need it.   Section 1304 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes a debtor engaged in business to operate their business, and incur ""trade credit,"" which I understand to be debt that is repaid quickly, i.e. 30 days.

Even though she is incorrect, it would be a good idea to hire a landlord-tenant attorney. It appears she is planning to make this as difficult as possible for you, so any slight missteps on your part may result in lengthy delays.

1851647,"You are correct that in many cases an attorney can be very helpful when applying for Social Security disability, since an attorney can assist you in the completion of forms and  getting medical evaluations and documentation of your disability.  There are several good attorneys in Minnesota that can help you with your claim."

1824862,"A lawyer who permissively withdraws from a contingency fee representation waives his fee. Depending on how much time you have before the statute of limitation runs, you may want to take the lawyer to fee arbitration with the county Bar Association to establish that he is owed no fee. That should make it easier to get another lawyer."
1795058,"Talking to somebody without your parent's permission is NOT a crime.  I know you don't want to hear this, but you should probably listen to your parents.  They could make your b/f's life pretty miserable and if you happen to find yourselves doing something more that just ""hanging out"" your b/f might find himself in jail.  Wise up and listen to you parents."
1822287,"It may appear as if you are seen conflicting answers here.  My take on the law is that the compensation disability payments are not payable for the first seven (7) days of disability unless you are disabled for 22 days or more.  If at any point from this accident, your days disabled reach 22, not necessarily consecutive, you are then retroactively paid workers' compensation disability benefits for the first seven days that were withheld.  Section 440.12, Florida Statutes (2013) provides in pertinent part ""compensation is not allowed for the first 7 days of the disability‰Û_ However, if the injury results in disability of more than 21 days, compensation shall be allowed from the commencement of the disability.""  Also note that by disability, we do not mean you have to have been taken totally off work.  The Florida Workers' Compensation Law, chapter 440 of Florida Statutes, defines ""disability"" as ""‰Û_ Incapacity because of the injury to earn in the same or any other employment the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of the injury.""  Therefore, if pre-accident you were working five days per week eight hours per day and because of your workers' compensation injury, your workers' compensation doctor limits you to four hours per day and you therefore work a four hour day and in doing so earn less than you did pre-accident working an eight-hour day, I believe that is a day of disability."
1739184,"As has been stated, an ordinance violation means you are looking at a fine, not jail time.  An attorney such as myself who practices in Lake and McHenry Counties can help you if you so desire.  What to keep in mind with this, or any local ordinance violation is basically because the whole issue of going to jail is off the table, the Village or local municipality has a lower standard for proving their case.  The Supreme Court of Illinois has ruled that ""[c]onvictions for municipal ordinance violation are to be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence and do not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt."" City of Chicago v. Joyce, 38 Ill. 2d 368, 373, 232 N.E.2d 289, 291 (1967).    Keep this in mind if you take this matter to trial.  This does not mean you cannot win, just that the state has a lesser burden.  Good luck."
1813781,"It is unfortunate that your ex-spouse has chosen to behave this way, as ultimately it is your children that get hurt by his behavior.  It is always important following a divorce where minor children are involved to keep records and document the behaviors of the other parent, if you believe custody or visitation will ever been in issue later on.  You should keep records contemporaneously of when he is missing his visitation, how and if you are notified, and your attempts to encourage and facilitate visitation.  If your ex-husband continues to willfully and intentionally not exercise visitation, you may be able to file a Petition to Terminate Parental Rights and have your husband adopt the children.  In Tennessee you cannot terminate a parent's rights until there is someone ready to step in and adopt.  If it has been more than four months without him providing support or visiting with the children, then you would have grounds to file a Petition to Terminate his parental rights; however, there is a high burden in these kinds of cases and the burden is on you to first prove grounds for terminate by clear and convincing evidence and then you must prove that it is in the best interests of the children for his rights to be terminated.  Also, he is entitled to representation by an attorney for this type of proceeding and the court will appoint an attorney for him if he cannot afford one.  I am not sure that Petition for Contempt is what you would want to file, as he could simply start exercising his visitation and then no longer be in contempt; however, if he has the ability to pay his child support and is willfully not paying it the Court can hold him in contempt and he may even be incarcerated for his contempt.  You could also file a Petition to Modify that parenting plan, although you may want to give him more time of not exercising his parenting time before doing so and continued efforts on your part to attempt to encourage and facilitate visitation.  You could then modify the Permanent Parenting Plan to reflect his willful and continued lack of visitation with the children upon a finding of the Court of a substantial and material change in circumstances and that the modification is in the best interests of the children.  Of course, you would want to make sure that you appear in the best light possible before the Court on such a serious matter as this and that you have done nothing to discourage or dissuade the father from exercising his parenting time, as the Court would take an unfavorable view if this were the case.  I wish you and your family the best of luck in this matter and am sorry that both you and your children are going through this.  I would advise you to speak with an attorney in your area to discuss your case in greater detail and evaluate your options on how you may proceed."
2315538,"If I were you, I wouldn't listen to the prodding of the ""free"" public defender to ""make a deal"", would instead hire a reputable private criminal defense attorney in your town and threaten to take this all the way to trial if necessary...  As for the immigration law consequences, I wouldn't worry..  You will be able to renew your H-1B in the US without any problems - it will again be the ""employer's"" petition, nothing will be asked from you, aside from your passport validity date, as well as your educational and/or work experience qualifications, accompanied by your tax returns, W-2 and 3 latest pay stubs (and that too, only if you happen to be from the Indian subcontinent, otherwise forget about it).  The only ""issue"" of (possible inadmissibility) you will face when applying for the extension/renewal of your H-1B visa at your home country US consulate or in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto or Ottawa (I dare not say Tijuana..)  But that too will be easily resolved, with your immigration lawyer providing you with one heck of a ""Legal Memorandum of Law"" explaining, with case decision citations to boot, why you should not be deemed inadmissible.

Read up on the archives here on AVVO and you will quickly learn that most AVVO attorneys would tell you to IGNORE the civil demand letter you will receive.  They threaten to sue you civilly if you don't pay, but they will not for a variety of reasons.  There is no benefit to paying other than if it relieves your guilty conscience.  I recommend that you NOT pay at all, or if you must, call them up and offer to pay only $50 because you are elderly and likely on a fixed income.  IF you have the emotional fortitude, simply throw the letters away.  IF and only IF they file an actual lawsuit (they won't) you can pay then.  IF the police were not involved you will not have to go to court unless you receive a notice to appear in court.  I doubt any prosecutor would want to file criminal charges agains a 72 year old woman for stealing $6.00 worth of groceries from Wal-Mart, 2 weeks ago.  Don't steal again, and you'll be just fine.  IGNORE the civil demand--they're trying to steal from you now.  Don't let them."

1790153,"It sounds to me like you are currently in the middle of an court action in which you are requesting the court to allow you to relocate. In that regard you have followed the statute, asked the father first, he said no, filed your Petition for Relocation, gave notice to the father who timely filed a response objecting to your move, and a hearing was set. As part of your case you have to present evidence as to why it is in the ""best interests"" of your child for you to relocate, and you have decided to call your child as a witness at the hearing. So what do you do?  First you must file a motion called ""Motion to Allow Child Testimony"" and request a hearing on that motion PRIOR to your hearing date coming up. If there is not enough time to allow for it to be scheduled on the calendar before it, then you should ask for it to be heard/scheduled first on your hearing date. If the court hears your motion, you will have to show that the testimony is relevant, that the child has a certain level of maturity and can understand right from wrong, etc., It can be a very complicated process. Some judges have no issue speaking with a child, but they generally will do it in-camera. That means no one else is allowed in except the judge, the child and a court reporter. The judge asks the child questions he wants to about moving.  Rather than going on that, you should be preparing to show the judge why the move is in the best interest of the child. For instance, your moving for a job that is going to give you with the ability to better provide for your child. The move allows you to put the child in private school or a better school, or a magnet school which focuses on an interest of the child, the move allows the child to be closer to a family member (I.e., like a grandpa who is there to do father like things with him camping, fishing, playing ball) and become a positive role model while his dad is in prison.  All of these response are examples of how the move is beneficial to the child. It is likely you are going to have to bring up why dad is in prison. For how long? Does the child regularly visit the father. If so, how do you propose to continue that?  So you see, it becomes very complicated when one parent wants to move and the other doesn't agree. If you have not retained a lawyer you really need to do that as soon as possible. Good luck."

1813711,"You may have a case for discrimination due to pregnancy and/or for violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)'s non-retaliation requirement.  Pregnancy discrimination is unlawful under California and federal law.   FEDERAL RIGHTS:  In 1978, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII 42 U.S.C. å¤å¤ 2000e to 2000e‰ÛÒ17, by passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.   Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, ""discrimination"" means to treat a pregnant employee differently from non-pregnant employees, and adversely. The employee must be able to make a connection between the discriminatory treatment and the protected status (being pregnant). In other words, the employee will have to show that her pregnancy is reason the employer is treating her adversely. There are various ways to do this. Negative comments from supervisors or management; a sudden change in treatment (for the worse) as soon as or shortly after the employer learns about the pregnancy or the effects of pregnancy; or other incriminating conduct. Note it is not unlawful for an employer to apply the same leave of absence policy to pregnant and non-pregnant employees.   For information on pregnancy discrimination, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm   For information on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm   This law is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). www.EEOC.gov   Under federal law, leave taken for an employee's incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions is governed by the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. section 2101 et seq. (FMLA), just like leave for any other ""serious health condition"" of an employee.  See my Avvo guide to the FMLA for more information: http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=family-and-medical-leave-fmla-summary-of-key-provisions.  CALIFORNIA RIGHTS:  California employers must comply with federal law, as above, and also must comply with state law.  The California pregnancy disability leave law, Government Code section 12945(a) (PDLL), is part of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California Government Code sections 12900, et seq. (FEHA). The PDLL requires employers to provide employees up to four months of unpaid leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical conditions.  Under some circumstances, an employer may be required to transfer an employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions to a different job.  California has its own family and medical leave law, the California Family Rights Act, Government Code section 12945.2 (CFRA).  It is substantially similar to the FMLA, but an employee's incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition is not included in the definition of ""serious health condition.""  This is usually beneficial to the employee because CFRA leave and pregnancy disability leave are two separate and distinct rights under California law.  They do NOT run concurrently, as they do under the FMLA.  Instead, an employee in California may take four months of PDLL plus 12 weeks of family leave, provided of course that the employee meets the other conditions of these laws.  Please look at my guide to unlawful discrimination:  http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=what-is-unlawful-employment-discrimination--california-law which should help you understand lawful and unlawful discrimination, how to enforce your rights, and time limits.

1803731,"The other attorneys on this question are mistaken. There is no requirement that a 3-day notice be served in the same fashion as a summons. All that needs to happen is the person serving it needs to ""nail and mail"" as they call it.  In terms of using your deposit as last month's rent... you have to imagine it from the Landlord's position. How does he know you're not going to destroy the place this month before you leave? That is why he is holding onto the deposit as a deposit and not last month's rent.  Unfortunately, the fact that you improved the unit doesn't help you much. It certainly helps you in terms of not having deductions from you deposit but in terms of trying to apply the deposit to last month's rent--that is prohibited in the lease. A violation of the lease means an unlawful detainer.  The good news is this: an unlawful detainer action can't happen when possession is no longer at issue. If you move out at the end of the month, the unlawful detainer will turn into a normal lawsuit. At that point, he can only go after you for damages... and assuming your deposit is enough to cover last month's rent... WALA! there you go. He keeps your deposit and indirectly you've accomplished what you've wanted. Just make sure you don't get an eviction or judgment on your record. Go to Court and say you've moved out and that possession isn't at issue. Also point out that he has money of yours so no judgment should be issued.

1798959,"If you mean that you are now losing your SSI because your husband was recently approved for Social Security Disability Insurance, and the only reason you are losing your SSI is because of the amount of his Social Security Disability Insurance, according to my research you should not have to repay SSI payments that you received before he was approved. As of the date that he was approved, and received the lump sum payment from Social Security, you may no longer be eligible for SSI.  The lump sum amount, even though it is payment for months in the past, is not counted against in you the month that you already received payments, but he was not yet paid, it is only counted against you beginning in the month that he actually received the benefit (if he only qualified for SSI, this would be slightly different as you would then qualify for couple's benefits, so both of your benefits would be recalculated for the past-due months).   So if he were approved for benefits in July 2014, and Social Security determined that he was eligible for Past-Due Benefits beginning July 2013, even though he is now going to receive a lump sum that includes the months from July 2013 until June 2014, since he didn't actually receive those payments until July 2014, based on my research, Social Security will only count the income in the month the money was actually received.  If you receive a notice of overpayment for the situation discussed above, I would suggest that you consult with an attorney to determine the accuracy of the information. If you are actually trying to ask a different question, please feel free to clarify in the comments, and I will try to respond accordingly."

Whether your claim is worth perusing really depends upon how serious the burn was, the damage can range from irritation to a severe reaction.  If you condition is worsening that is generally not a good sign. You should see your family doctor or a dermatologist as soon as possible.

I agree with Ms. Lowry that you should probably wait until your grandson has been with you for six months, although I do not see anything in the law that requires you to wait. You will want to be appointed guardian over the person (both your grandchildren) and their estates, which entitles you to manage any monies they may earn or receive, until they are 18.

If she was offered 10 and refused it or never accepted it, then come sentencing the State can ask for whatever they want. They are not bound.  If the state induced her to plea on the same date of her plea by stating that they would only argue for 10 years, she probably stood a chance of filing a motion to withdraw her plea, but the time to file that motion is long passed.

There is a separate Seattle-specific ordinance that gets you an additional two month's rent on top of the State's damages. RCW 59.18.085(3) says what you are entitled to under these circumstances and it is a lot more than what your landlord is offering.   In order to invoke this remedy, you have to have proof that you advised your landlord in writing of the problems with the property. If you do not have such a letter, write one now.  Then wait ten days (see RCW 59 18 070, 090) and contact Jim Metz who is the lead in the City's Office of Code Compliance/Tenant Rights. Mr. Metz or one of his assistants will advise your landlord if the City is going to make him relocate you. Damaged moldy furniture is tough, but not impossible to value.

1829219,"Mr. Harvey hit on some good points, so I will just touch on a few key issues not addressed:  1) Do you have a lease? If so, then the Protecting Tenants Act of 2009 (federal law)  will provide some protection for you (you will be considered a bona fide tenant and the lease will have to be honored). If you do not have a lease, then under the Act you must be given 90 days prior to vacating the premises. So to answer your question about time to move out, yes you have time. The bank will have to re-schedule the sale and then proceed to sale. Once this happens, then they will begin the eviction process where the above will apply (your rights as a tenant). The intent of the law in FL is to prohibit exactly what you are worried about - not having time or notice to move out. Make sure you keep track of what is going on, including when the next sale date will be. This should give you a pretty good idea of how much time you are looking at (figure at least 90 days from the sale date assuming you do not have a valid lease - if you have been receiving foreclosure papers at the house, then you should receive the notice from Plaintiff's attorney of the new sale date). The eviction process will take time (at least a month, as a very conservative estimation) and the bank will have to obtain a writ of eviction against you and your family. So you have time, which is good. You need to start thinking about where you are going to move and will need money for moving costs (cash for keys discussed below will help in this regard!).  2) Generally speaking, you can negotiate for $ before your lease has ended (called ""cash for keys""). Strategically, you should try to negotiate with the bank (or the attorneys for the bank) a decent amount of $ before your lease is up to get the most money possible, since the bank will not want to wait until the end of the lease and will be more likely to offer a decent amount of $ to vacate the occupants from the property. A good amount is anywhere from 3k to 5k - the idea being you want to receive enough to cover moving costs and first month rent and security at your new location. Be careful of some ""eviction agents"" that will try to persuade you that you have to move out right away.

1806363,"If that is the only fact pointing in the bad direction, and there are none other, ie, there is no context which suggests it, then I don't agree.  Markets generally do not function perfectly, and prices depend on both access to information and an abundance of buyers and sellers, and myriad other details.    However there may be some law in your jurisdiction which has an impact on this and if you have been charged with a crime, then you had better get a lawyer."
1802381,"If you could provide a bit more information about who is disabled (SSI), as well as who is getting Medicaid (just the person on SSI or everyone, etc.) in your family it would help in giving more specific guidance.   Based on what you wrote here is some information that covers only the PA side of things.   SSI will go with the person (and usually comes with Medicaid for that person). In PA a person does get Medicaid with their SSI so that part is likely not an issue. However, SSI is income and asset based so that is always a constant issue to be aware of.   Your biggest issue is how you treat the sale of your home.   First and foremost, if you sell your primary residence and move to PA and buy a new home (and therefore do not have a lot of money in the bank), then yes, you can apply for Medicaid AND likely be found eligible in PA as well. Medicaid does not count a primary residence (unless it is a huge mansion worth $$$).   So, if you stay within the income and asset limits, and/of if the children (i do not know if you have minor children) are disabled you and they will likely get Medicaid.   Now, looking at it a different way.   If you move to PA and don't buy a home (you rent instead or live with someone) and you have a lot of money in the bank ($2000.00 or more), you might not be eligible for SSI (yourself or your spouse) or Medicaid (as both are income and asset based).   Minor children, if they have a disability, would be able to get Medicaid as your income and assets would not be deemed to them under special needs loophole.  Adult children with a disability (not on SSI) would also likely be eligible if they are limited in their ability to work and required medical care and/or medications. They will also be required to apply for SSI for themselves.   Adult children with a disability (and on SSI) would still be covered as long as they do not have assets over the limit in their own name. Mom and dad's assets and income are not deemed to them.   Minor children without a disability might not get regular medicaid but would likely get some form of CHIP as they are minors and are covered in PA (based on family income and assets). A copay may be involved depending on the income level of the parents.   Adult children without a disability and able to work might be able to get medicaid based on their own current income and asset level, but the threshold is different. They might need to get covered through healthcare.gov and get a subsidy.  Now, if you don't plan to buy a home and the money would be a problem for you, you may have an alternative based upon which person in the home is disabled.  If one of your minor children (or adult children) is disabled and on SSI currently, you could create a special needs trust (supplemental) for that child's benefit and then transfer/gift the excess money from the sale of the home into the special needs trust and that transfer would be an exempt transfer for Medicaid application purposes. So sheltering the money into the trust could help the adults get Medicaid.   But lets be clear. While it will help you shelter the money and get Medicaid, it does come with limitations that many people do not pay attention to. The sheltering of the money is a one way trip. You can not use the money for anything but for that child's benefit. You can't treat the trust as a checking account and take out what you want when you need it.   Always remember, this particular method of sheltering assets so a Parent can get Medicaid is what we call in my office ""the nuclear option"", it isn't pretty but it works.   In your case it would not likely be a viable option. I just wanted to mention it in case you did not intend to buy a home in PA and would be coming into the state with excess cash.   I do recommend that you consult directly with an attorney that does special needs planning/medicaid law so that you can plan out your move in more detail to make sure it is successful for everyone in your family.

The question of prohibiting the introduction of the video evidence is a bit broader, because the court will allow only admissible evidence.  You may be able to argue at trial, or by filing, in advance of trial, a ""motion in limine"", arguing that the video evidence is inadmissible because it violates one of several evidentiary rules--hearsay, lack of foundation, lack of authentication, its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value, etc.  In order to gain more time, look at Iowa Criminal Rule 2.11.  You have only a brief time to file pretrial motions.  Immediately file a motion seeking to extend the Rule 2.11 motion deadline.  Also ask to extend the deposition and discovery deadline.

1787954,"As you evidently learned, the FMLA's one-year employment requirement does not have to be in the immediately preceding year. The same is true for California's similar California Family Rights Act (CFRA).  Because you are trying to conceive, you should know that California provides for leave due to pregnancy beyond what the FMLA provides, if an employee is eligible. Also, Federal and California law protect women from discrimination based on pregnancy.  FEDERAL RIGHTS:  In 1978, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII 42 U.S.C. å¤å¤ 2000e to 2000e‰ÛÒ17, by passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.   Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, ""discrimination"" means to treat a pregnant employee differently from non-pregnant employees, and adversely. The employee must be able to make a connection between the discriminatory treatment and the protected status (being pregnant). In other words, the employee will have to show that her pregnancy is reason the employer is treating her adversely. There are various ways to do this. Negative comments from supervisors or management; a sudden change in treatment (for the worse) as soon as or shortly after the employer learns about the pregnancy or the effects of pregnancy; or other incriminating conduct. Note it is not unlawful for an employer to apply the same leave of absence policy to pregnant and non-pregnant employees.   For information on pregnancy discrimination, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm   For information on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm   This law is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). www.EEOC.gov   Under federal law, leave taken for an employee's incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions is governed by the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. section 2101 et seq. (FMLA), just like leave for any other ""serious health condition"" of an employee.  See my Avvo guide to the FMLA for more information: http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=family-and-medical-leave-fmla-summary-of-key-provisions.  CALIFORNIA RIGHTS:  California employers must comply with federal law, as above, and also must comply with state law.  The California pregnancy disability leave law, Government Code section 12945(a) (PDLL), is part of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California Government Code sections 12900, et seq. (FEHA). The PDLL requires employers to provide employees up to four months of unpaid leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical conditions.  Under some circumstances, an employer may be required to transfer an employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions to a different job.  California has its own family and medical leave law, the California Family Rights Act, Government Code section 12945.2 (CFRA).  It is substantially similar to the FMLA, but an employee's incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition is not included in the definition of ""serious health condition.""  This is usually beneficial to the employee because CFRA leave and pregnancy disability leave are two separate and distinct rights under California law.  They do NOT run concurrently, as they do under the FMLA.  Instead, an employee in California may take four months of PDLL plus 12 weeks of family leave, provided of course that the employee meets the other conditions of these laws.  Please look at my guide to unlawful discrimination:  http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=what-is-unlawful-employment-discrimination--california-law which should help you understand lawful and unlawful discrimination, how to enforce your rights, and time limits.

Which means that, yes, if a person creates a corporation and then willfully engages in unlawful acts [such as copyright infringement] through that company then that person can be held DIRECTLY liable for the damages caused by those acts [not, as my colleague suggests, indirectly liable under the vicarious or contributory infringement theories].   Nonetheless, doing business through a corporation remains very smart for many other business and marketing reasons and, as applied to your infringement concern, if the infringement is done ""innocently"" as opposed to ""willfully"" then it‰Ûªs unlikely that the corporate officer who engaged in the infringement would be held personally responsible [though he or she would likely still be sued].

1821658,"It is unfortunate that you find yourself in this position.  I would agree with the Juvenile Court that this is not an emergency.  I am not sure if you still live in or near the county that the divorce was entered in, but if so you would most likely need to file a Petition to Modify Custody and Visitation along with an Ex Parte Restraining Order that gives you temporary exclusive physical custody of your son.  Although you would not want her to show back up demanding her parenting time under the plan, since she is out of the picture it is not actually an emergency situation.  If neither you or your ex-wife still live in the county the divorce was finalized in, then you may first need to file a Motion to Transfer the case to your current county of residence.  In order to be successful on a Petition to Modify you will need to prove that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the Permanent Parenting Plan was entered by a preponderance of the evidence.  Based on the facts you have listed there has been a substantial and material change in that her situation has rapidly devolved.  The Court would then look to the factors to determine the best interest of the child.  Given that you have remained a stable and loving father and have served as the primary caretaker for the child, it would seem that you are in a position to be deemed the primary residential parent for your son.  The Court would then have to decide what visitation with the mother is in your son's best interest.  That may be supervised parenting time, drug screens, every other weekend, etc. depending on her particular circumstances and what would be best for the child in light of her particular circumstances.  You should seek the advice of child custody attorney in your area.  It is very difficult for people to attempt to represent themselves in these types of cases.  Many times child custody matters are highly contested and you may find yourself having a trial before the Court where you would be held to the same standard as an attorney on Rules of Procedure, Rules of Evidence, etc.  This is an unfortunate situation and I wish you and your family the best of luck going forward."

1789002,"Parental rights can be terminated on several grounds, but it sounds like you're talking about abandonment because you reference time (""how long do you have to wait"").  In California, abandonment can be found if the other parent has gone for at least one year without contacting the child OR one year without paying any money towards the child's support.  The devil is in the details, which I will give below.  ONE YEAR:  It can be any year, not just the one preceding the date you file for a stepparent adoption.  So if your child is 5 and the other parent didn't have contact from the time he/she was ages two to four, then abandonment can still be found. (Also, if the child was left with a non-parent, then you only have to wait six months to bring your action.)  CONTACT:  Token contacts do not count.  Say, for instance, that the parent has been absent for a year but sent a birthday card to the child or called once or twice -- those contacts would probably be considered token and you would still be able to tell the court the other parent had not had contact for one year ""within the meaning of the statute.""  Another word on contact:  you will probably have to prove you did nothing to frustrate contact.  Maybe you moved, and your phone number and address changed, and the other parent complains to the judge that he/she had no way to contact the child.  If you can show the other parent still had a way to contact you (for instance, your email address remained the same, or your parents still live in the same house with the same phone number, and the other parent didn't try to contact you using any of these methods), you will still probably be successful in terminating their rights.  MONEY/SUPPORT:  Oftentimes the other parent will stand up in court and say, ""Judge, I was never ordered to pay support, so that's why I didn't send money!""  That argument won't fly.  The law imposes a duty on a parent to support their child to the best of their ability, so the absence of a court order to do so will not save their rights from being terminated.  Also, even if they did pay support, this will not automatically save them from having their rights terminated.  It all comes down to the bond the child shares with the absent parent.  Has there been enough contact for that child to care about the parent?  Does the child's bond with the absent parent outweigh the bond with the stepparent?    This is a tricky area of the law and all judges take it very seriously.  The Supreme Court has said the two most trying and important cases a judge will ever hear are death penalty cases and termination of parental rights cases.  Get an attorney who has done many of these so they can guide you through the process.  I personally love this type of case -- so often we are setting a child free from a truly neglectful or truly bad parent so they can fearlessly love the parent of their heart, their stepparent.  All the best."

1808811,"I am an attorney licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the States of Delaware and New Jersey.  My practice includes employment, business and health care law. Before I respond to your inquiry, I must state that we have not spoken, I have not reviewed the relevant documents and facts, and I do not represent you. Therefore, my discussion below is not a legal opinion, but is informational only. Finally, my discussion applies only to issues to which Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or Federal law applies.  That being said, if your accrued vacation pay should be paid out to you per employer policy, then it is yours regardless of whether you sign anything, and there is no reason to swap it for severance.  Otherwise, even if you sign the document, you have still been terminated without cause ('not working out' is not cause).  You should make sure you put that in writing in an email to your employer - that you were terminated and did not quit.  You can use that email as evidence.  You may want to have the agreement state that the employer will not contest unemployment.  /Christopher E. Ezold/"
1803634,"It is difficult to know whether or not he will receive jail time upon being arrested.  That will depend on a number of factors. If there is a child at home you must be careful because you can have problems if you allow the child to witness domestic violence. You can also go to family court, fill out a family offense petition and request an order of protection that would remove him from the home. I suggest you consider speaking to a counselor and/or an attorney to decide the best way of moving forward. Good luck."
1829236,"Mr. Birr has described an appropriate procedure.  To make sure you hit every nail on the head, you should complete a Form 8275, Disclosure Statement, and attach it to your return.  Doing that makes sure that the issue will be brought to the attention of the appropriate office in the IRS and also helps to protect you from potential penalties later on down the road (because you properly disclosed the issue to the IRS on your return, and using Form 8275 is a good way to do that).  Form 8275 can be downloaded from the IRS website here:  http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-8275,-Disclosure-Statement"
2323684,"I agree with Bob Lauver.  In general, you are required to undergo evaluations at reasonable times and places.  It sounds like they want you to have an MMPI or other psychiatric testing.  You should be very concerned with whether the person doing the testing is an insurance company pet.   In that case, the carrier could be trying to set you up with the goal of ending your benefits.   If the testing was not prescribed by the treating physician, discussing it in advance is a good idea.   This sort of thing is a common game of adjusters in teacher assault cases we have handled.  Be aware you may also have a State Long Term Disability claim if you were vested and you may have a Social Security Disability claim, depending on the evidence.  Talk with a Board Certified Specialist ASAP.     Good luck, George"
1795549,"The positive is probably not.  The negative is that you are concerned that you have communications that might be illegal.  Be aware that every keystroke on computer or smartphone is always retrievable.  For PO to monitor, he or she would need a warrant to do so.  Good luck."
1803889,"You should consult with a local attorney. You may have a claim for defamation and/or interference with prospective economic advantage. In any case, for your protection, consult soon."
1817862,"MN has a 6 year statute of limitations for contracts.  Personally, I think one would be wise to evaluate the time needed to collect the alleged damages and make a determination whether that is time well spent.  You certainly could sue this person in conciliation court (small claims); however, there is a $75 filing fee to do so.  Moreover, even if you win, that does not necessarily put money in your pocket.  Attempting to collect money can be quite tricky and expensive.  Given that you have been hounding this person for two years over the sum of $850, I am guessing this is not a wealthy person and suspect collecting this money may be a challenge.  I think you may want to chalk this up a lesson learned and move on."
1829467,No. You do not need to file a waiver.
1618837,"We specialize in handling this type of case, and we have an office in the Dallas area, in Irving.  Also, we can make the arrangements via e-mail so you don't need to come in to the office if you don't want to.  If you're more comfortable meeting us, then by all means schedule an appointment.  We have gotten over 2500 debt lawsuits dismissed in the last few years, so we know what we're doing."
1826954,"You can hire an attorney for the sole purpose of your interview, however, note that an attorney's role is very limited during the interview process."
1797423,"Do you owe back child support? If so, she maybe referring to a  child support violation petition?  If it is a child support matter then the support magistrate can refer it to a family court judge to issue a warrant if there is proof in the case that you have been served with summons and have failed to appear in court when summoned. I suggest that you speak with a family court attorney."
1801056,"My colleagues are correct.  In District Court actions, the Court will enter a 3-507 dismissal most frequently when a Plaintiff has filed a lawsuit, but has not given notice to the court that it has successfully made the required service of process upon the Defendant nor has the Plaintiff timely requested a re-issue of the summons.  The Plaintiff has an opportunity to respond to the Court's 3-507 Notice of Dismissal within 30 days, to provide good cause as to why their case should not be dismissed.  If no response is given, the case is dismissed without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff may simply file the lawsuit again, if not barred by the applicable statute of limitations."
1827316,"A will might be rejected because of undue influence, lack of testamentary capacity, fraud, or because it fails to comply with the legal requirements for a will. If a court does not accept a particular will, the testator's estate will pass under the terms of the most recent valid will, or, if there is none, according to the rules of intestate succession."
1761403,"After 9/11, all in-transit passengers coming through the US not from a visa exempt or waiver country do need a visa. If you accrued over 180 days of unlawful presence, you may have a 3-year bar to reentry and thus not be eligible for a visa. However, all is not lost as you may qualify for a nonimmigrant visa waiver. See the article below."
2007687,"Generally, support is only retroactive to the date of filing of the request for support.  There are exceptions, so you do exactly what you have written, file a Request for Hearing for Support and check the box requesting support orders be made retroactive to the date of filing of the divorce.  It doesn't hurt to ask.  In your declaration attached to or filed with the motion, you can explain the facts including the default status and the failure of the other party to provide support during that 4 year period.  If the other party is paying support voluntarily and the support orders are retroactive to any date the court deems appropriate, then the paying spouse gets credit for monies they have paid during the time encompassed by the support orders only.    In some cases, such as those where one party is receiving public assistance, the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) is a great resource and helps with filing, service and collection of support matters.  Retroactive support is available for reimbursement of public aide monies paid out by the State.  That is when DCSS has exclusive jurisdiction over support.    If you are just looking for some additional help filing or filling out your forms, you can also meet with the Family Court Facilitator's Office.  They cannot give out legal advice, but they can help you fill out paperwork to get your motion filed.  Time is of the essence, so please file as soon as possible.  If the court does not grant retroactive support earlier than the date you filed the motion for support, then you will want to have filed as soon as possible to help you and your child(ren) as much as possible as quickly as possible."
1949888,"Since the charges were dropped, there should be no bar to you becoming a notary public here in Florida.  Simply being accused of something is never enough to cause ineligibility unless already licensed/regulated.  You should be candid about the arrest though, because there is a record of that. It may be to your overall advantage to expunge the record of your arrest and the charges being dropped.  Yes, even dropped charges create a record, and in Florida, if you meet certain qualifications, you can apply to have that record expunged, or destroyed."
1807757,"It may depend on what the reason for a continuance was. Local rules (Marion County) require that emergency continuances can only be filed 7 days out, and they need to be true emergencies.  In other circumstances, they must be filed at least 10 days ahead of time and you must have the opportunity to object. You may want to file a formal objection if they file for a continuance again. I am sorry that you are going through this. Best wishes to you."
1811867,As mentioned by previous posters it appears that the Sheriff's office is not going to help so you have to use the civil process.  It is unfortunate that you have to take legal action to get your property back but that is the situation you are in.  It is possible that if you contact a local attorney they can send a letter on your behalf to your son-in-law that educates him on your options and how it would be cheaper and easier for him if he cooperates with you.
1796667,"It is inappropriate for you to question the witness directly.  If for whatever reason your attorney cannot adequately prepare for the deposition, you might consider discussing with opposing counsel the time and expense to be saved by stipulating to allow you to question the witness within agreeable limits instead of having to break every time you need to coach your attorney."
1812833,You really need to speak with an attorney right away.  Your situation is complicated and you need to carefully consider your next steps.  I would be happy to speak with you to help you carefully consider your options.
1823015,"It is never advised to go into any proceeding with an attorney.  As for jail time, it is difficult to say.  A lot will be determined by the judge, the amount owed, and how late/how many payments you missed.  In any event, do not attend the hearing alone if at all possible.  Contact a family law attorney to assist you."
1785479,"It is extremely rare to take depositions in family court proceedings.  However, in certain proceedings interrogatories can be utilized to serve the same purpose.  Ultimately, you will be entitled to a hearing during which you have the right to call witnesses and submit evidence, as well as cross examine witnesses called against you.  This all takes place on the record.   Having said all of this, there is no problem asking your attorney and he/she would be in the best position to advise you as to whether or not it is available or recommended. Good luck."
1819495,The date on the green card is like the date on a drivers license. It only shows the date the card needs to be renewed. If a person does something that results in the LPR stats to be lost ie stay outside of teh US for more than a year without a reentry permit then it is like a judge telling a person in traffic court he has lost his license. The DL may say expires on -1/-1/2020 but the license has no value as the judge has cancelled the DL.
1819475,"Having a lawyer with no experience in this field is sometimes worse than having no attorney at all.  If you don't have the money to hire a good private lawyer, get in touch with one of the free legal services providers: http://www.justice.gov/eoir/probono/states.htm.  The judge will likely give you some time to get a lawyer."
1830272,"First thing you need to do is get a lawyer, ma'am, because you are in way over your head.  Before you decide to ""use his medical history against him"" you need to understand the law and what you are trying to accomplish.  Finding ""governmental physicians?""  Please, ma'am, get a lawyer before you kill whatever chance you have of succeeding in a legal fight."
1792300,"Theoretically you could apply for both at the same time, but if the H-1B is approved first and the H-4 is approved thereafter, then you will be in H-4 status and unable to work, and then your new employer would have to file another H-1B petition with filing fees. I doubt the employer would be happy about that. If the H-1B is filed with premium processing and approved quickly, then you could immediately withdraw the H-4 application before it's adjudicated."
1800549,"As long as your mother is mentally/legally competent to sign the POA, it should not matter where she signs it as long as it is witnessed and preferably notarized.  This is not a document that is filed with any court, but a private document between the two of you."
1925113,"If you can't afford an attorney, re-assert your position, send the current LL copies of your proof of payment, and if the LL continues to assert his position that you are in arrears $2k, wait until the LL takes you to court for eviction and show the evidence to the judge.  It really is that simple.    Either the judge believes you and sets aside the $2k and the eviction, or he gives you at least 10 days to pay before the LL has the ability to evict you.  If you hire an attorney to take this case to negotiate the debt, you will likely just be out the amount you pay the attorney.  If you hire an attorney to take the eviction case, the attorney can file a counter-suit for attorney fees.  If the judge believes that the case was frivolous, or if the lease calls for the prevailing party to recover their attorney fees, you will be reimbursed for the compensation that you paid to your attorney."
1790416,"First, you can generally get a lesser charge if you contest a ticket, but doing this skillfully will require an attorney, who will likely cost more than $250. If you truly cannot afford it (and can't borrow it from your mom), the court may consider suspending the fines and costs, but its going to be hard to convince a judge that a college student can't come up with $250.  The ticket will only effect your license if you have several others in the last few years. You license is not going to be suspended here unless you have some serious traffic law issues recently.  It may result in higher insurance rates."
1701977,"Your questions is a little ambiguous.  Is $22,000 their top offer, or is it their initial settlement offer?  If you have not done so, you really need to consult an attorney.  Settlement offers encompass quite a few things.  So, without knowing the facts of your case, the nature of your injuries, the length, type and reasonableness of treatment etc., it would be hard for an attorney to be able to answer this question without more facts."
1809367,"Attorneys WIlner and Behar summarize your options. It is nice to have options. The good news, now you have DACA is that you can start the process without the fears that might explain why you have not tried in 7 years.  And the even better news is that if you file your family taxes for the last three years, now you have a SSN,  you will possibly get a refund that will cover the fees you might need to pay to an immigration lawyer to help you to your residency. Good luck."
1828148,"You will need to got the Clerk of Superior Court's office in Cherokee County at the courthouse and file a Proceeding for Summary Ejectment.  After proper notice and service of process on the Defendant, the case will be heard before a Magistrate.  If the Magistrate rules in your favor, he/she will issue an Order for the Defendant to surrender the premises, including removal of his possessions (including the mobile home).  That is, assuming that the person actually owns the mobile home and is willing to take responsibility.  If it is financed, the owner is behind on payments, and has just decided to abandon it, well, then, you may end-up moving it just to get rid of it."
1743727,"This is common error from USCIS.  Sometimes they don't have the capacity to make the hyphen mark in a name.  You should immediately contact the 1800 customer service number located on the receipt notice and discuss this with a USCIS representative.  most likely, your name will appear on the green card as it does here, so it is important to follow up."
1892584,Suggest you contact an NJAJ member such as Vesper and Quattrone.  Good thing the person put it in writing! Very thoughtful of them.  They may possibly have violated their corporate duties as well.  ] Most NJAJ members give free consultations. Good luck!
1806286,"Time spent in jail awaiting trial and sentencing counts as against any sentence actually imposed on a 1 to 1 basis. The three day rumor you heard is likely a misunderstanding of the speedy trial rule.   If a person is in jail awaiting trial, that person has a right to a speedy trial. There are laws that say how long the government has to bring the person to trial. The length of time varies with the offense level and is commonly referred to as the speedy trial clock. Each day spent in jail awaiting trial counts as three days against the clock.   So, if we take a felony case as an example, the State must bring a person accused of a felony to trial within 270 days of charging them. See http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2945.71 If this person does not waive his or her right to a speedy trial, and cannot make bail, each day he or she spends in jail will count as three against the 270 clock giving the state 90 actual days to bring him or her to trial. Typically, the speedy trial clock is not an issue because the defense can waive the right to a speedy trial."
1802425,You need to bring a motion to remove Trustee. You will have to hire a lawyer. Probate judges take misuse or abuse of the beneficiaries pretty seriously.
1843274,"You have posted the same plea for help for several days, and you have received several responses you are apparently not reading.  You have a lawyer and no one here can second guess someone who knows all the facts of your case.  If you can't speak with your lawyer, hire another one."

Get the realtor to document everything also -- when she talked to her, how, where, etc.    If the buyers withdraw, you could have a claim against her for interfering with your contract.   Same goes for your contract with your realtor.   Talk to an attorney....sooner than later."
1806741,"You may have to wait until the initial appearance to know exactly what you'll be charged with.  It will be a civil ordinance violation if the designated court is a city/village municipal court and can be either civil or criminal if scheduled in a county circuit court.    As noted by others, the prosecutor has discretion on how and whether to charge a case, regardless of what charges are referred by police."
1808517,"You will need to file a Petition to proceed In Forma Pauperis.  This Petition asks the Court to waive the filing fees because you cannot afford them.  You can do this at the time you file your Complaint in Divorce.  Your local county law library should have all the forms (Petition to proceed in Forma Pauperis, a sample Complaint in Divorce) or at least be able to point you in the right direction.   I attached the form Mercer County, PA uses and you should be able to use this form and just include your county (Armstrong?) in the headings.  Don't forget to check the local rules.  Good luck!"
1810866,"It appears the USCIS has decided to take another look at the case. Keep in mind that the USCIS has the statutory authority to revoke any petition for ""good and sufficient cause"". However, the federal regulations require that the petitioner or applicant must be provided with notice and an opportunity to respond."
1824815,"Without reading the entire Note it would seem that since you accepted prepayment of principal only the remaining principal balance should be amortized over the remaining term of the amortization schedule using the full payment stated in the Note.  The borrower has accelerated the term by making prepayment of principal which you accepted.  You now have to run a new amortization schedule using the remaining princpal balance with the monthly payments stated in the Note. The borrower is not in default since they made all the interest payments and prepaid principal thus accelerating the Note.  You can not raise the interest rate as there does not seem to be a default.  If you enforce the original payment amount under the original amortization term the loan would be repaid  sooner as the borrower has pre-paid 1/3 of the principal.  You should bring the Note to an attorney to review.  Chances are you can insist on the full monthly payment stated in the Note, however, there will need to be a new amortization schedule computed and the amount of interest from each payment would be greatly reduced with the amount of principal being greatly increased.  Your remaining term would be much shorter."
1810252,You need to return to family court.
1795866,"Get it cleared up. You can call the PD and do it yourself but it usually beneficial to hire an attorney to help.  An attorney may be able to resolve it so you avoid a conviction that will bring points.  It might be more expensive to hire an attorney versus just paying the ticket but in the long run it is worth it.  Also, If you just pay without clearing up the information the points can go on your dad's driving record."
1828860,"The short answer is:  your friend.  First, with respect to the additional tax, since the return is now presumably correct that is the tax your friend owes and that he would have owed originally if the return had been properly prepared so he will have to pay the tax in any event.  Unfortunately, your friend will also be responsible for the penalties and interest he will now have to pay because of the mistake.  He will at the least have to pay the failure to pay penalties and might also have to pay the accuracy-related penalties if the error was obvious.  He might be able to request the IRS to abate some of the penalties and interest because of the mistake by this company; however, if your friend wasn't really entitled to claim any deduction for education expenses the IRS will almost certainly not abate the penalties or the interest.  About the most your friend can do is to file a complaint with the IRS Office of Professional Responsibility about this company and the individual who actually prepared the return.  The IRS should investigate the complaint and might take action against them if they determine that the errors were done on purpose."
1829598,"An unfortunately more and more ""classic"" scenario. Should hire an experienced immigration lawyer to prosecute your case with all the zealousness that is needed, and even file an Mandamus action on your behalf in Federal Court, once all of your ""administrative remedies"" are ""exhausted"".  That should put a rocket in CIS' rear-end and move them to some action."
1793569,"A Will cannot be changed by anyone other than the person who wrote the Will.  It follows, then, that the Will cannot be changed after the person dies.  If you believe that there will be problems when your father dies about identifying a valid Will or about fraudulent modifications of his Will, there are steps you can take now.  One of the best and most iron-clad approaches would be for your father to take out a life insurance policy naming you and your brother as the sole beneficiaries.  Life insurance passes outside of a Will and she would not be able to manipulate or control it as long as the Beneficiary Designations were not fraudulently changed.  But the insurance company has its own procedures to help ensure that only the insured can change Beneficiary Designations.  Another approach would be for your father to create and fund a By-Pass Trust right now--while he is alive.  A lot of people know of By-Pass Trusts being created through a Will or Trust after death.  But they actually can be created while he is alive.  He also can create Pay on Death (POD) designation for some assets that he owns in his own name--such as bank accounts, etc.  There are many other approaches that your father may take to ensure that you and your brother are not accidentally or fraudulently disinherited.  Please see an estate planning attorney in the state in which your father lives and please speak with your father about visiting the attorney with you."
2146659,"Let me be the first to tell you that actions have consequences.  You apparently admitted that you wrote checks for goods or services totaling $458 and that the checks bounced and you never repaid the money.   That is called theft.  It is punishable by up to 6 months in the county jail and a fine of up to $2000.  Since you forced the District Attorney to file a case in court, you are also liable for paying part of the court's cost related to handling your case.  You AGREED to go on probation for a certain length of time so that you could pay that money back.   In return, the District Attorney agreed to NOT ask the judge to put you in jail.   You can ask the judge to reduce your probation fees.  It looks like you've already done that.   Normally, probation fees are around $60 per month. Is that what you are paying? Is it higher or lower?  I understand that you have trouble doing community service.  Did the judge tell you that you are excused from that or did he tell you that you need to do it over the next 12 months?  If he excused you, the only thing that he really wants is the $458.   He doesn't want this money for himself.  He doesn't want it so that he can give it to the state of Texas.  He wants it so that the people that you stole from can have their money.    If you want all of this to stop, you can stop it right now and you won't have to pay another dime to anyone.   Walk in and tell the judge that you'd rather just get convicted and go to jail.  I'm sure he probably won't sentence you to very many days.  I'm thinking 10 days or less.  It's not like you have to worry about anyone checking your record when you apply for a job or anything.    It is YOUR choice.  You can take care of your responsibilities on probation or do the time."
1820925,"As other responses have indicated, you will not lose your benefits for part-time work alone. In other words, just because you are working and able to earn money, does not mean that your disability will be taken away. However, when your disability is reviewed, your work will be considered if Social Security is able to establish that you have reached medical improvement. If you have not yet been on disability benefits for 24 months when you are able to start making substantial money, your earnings can cause a Medical Review (see http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/416/416-0990.htm).  So if you have already been on benefits for 24 months or more, you are correct, Social Security will be most concerned about whether your earnings have exceeded Substantial Gainful Activity. This can only happen after you have already used all nine of your trial work months ( you use a trial work month in 2014 in any month that you make $770 or more in a month - it was $750 in 2013). If you have used all your trial work months, Social Security will only stop your benefit for work activity alone, if you then make more than Substantial Gainful Activity ($1070 per month in 2014). You can still be reviewed based on a periodic continuing disability review that normally occur once every 3-7 years.  When doing work, it is always important to consider whether your part-time work is evidence that you are not disabled. For example if you applied only because of your physical condition, but you are now doing work that regularly requires you to stand for extended periods of time, or to lift large amount of weight, even though you are only doing it on a part-time basis, it may be evidence that you are not as limited as you were previously. If you are receiving benefits for mental health, if you are able to do a position that requires attention to detail, focus, maintaining a regular schedule and working with the public on a regular basis, these types of things can also be proof that your condition is improving."
1795126,"The brief quick question is very good. There is a good quick answer for it.  Whoever became the owner(s) after the demise of the parent signs a deed that will convey the property to the new owner.  The purpose of probate court proceedings is to settle for all legal and practical purposes who became the owner(s) after them demise of the parent.  And that, requires more information about the specific situation that is not yet provided already.  Wishing you good luck.  But notice, no matter what you do there are legal aspects to what you do, and to get counsel for your specific situation you will get more benefit from your own lawyer as it is difficult to glean anything correctly on line with a few facts from strangers.  Note also, I am not yet agreeing to be your lawyer going forward on this matter and am making assumptions here. I am easy enough to find for consultation or referral.

They do not have clients, they have customers and their training requires them to be fair to both sides. My experience has been that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Be polite to them and they are polite to you. Treat them like dirt and guess what will happen to you?  If you really feel like someone has a vendetta, call your state representative and ask his/her office to look into it. Your state representative is happy to help you fix a real problem.

If not, then IMHO, this is enforceable by a contempt action.  File it and let the Judge tell you you are wrong.  You need a CA attorney.  This is a matter of State law.  I would strongly suggest that you consult with a local attorney (perhaps selected from the AVVO website resources) with experience in this area of law, to offer a free initial consultation and perhaps assist with the process.

What you may be thinking about is something called the ""Romeo and Juliet"" law. Florida‰Ûªs ""Romeo and Juliet"" law was created in 2007 to address concerns about high school age youth being labeled as sexual offenders or sexual predators as a result of participating in a consensual sexual relationship.

1800579,"The burden of proof in a criminal case is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is drastically higher than in a civil case. In fact, think back to the OJ Simpson trial which is an example if a case where a criminal jury found the defendant not guilty but a civil jury found him liable in a wrongful death action. Plus unlike a medical malpractice case, this is a much cheaper case for a civil attorney to litigate.   The doctor should have retained counsel steady but if not, should do so immediately.  Setting up a strong defense lawyer could discourage and discredit the plaintiff."
1821739,"Defense challenges to arrest warrants (and search warrants) are highly fact-specific, and it is truly not possible to evaluate a specific case in a public information forum, especially not based on the limited facts presented here.  Moreover, if a person is wanted on a warrant, and after arrest it is determined that the arrested defendant is indeed the wanted person, there may be little remedy for technical defects in the warrant.   On the other hand, if the person was mistakenly arrested, then he should obviously be released and may have a civil claim based on false arrest if the error was egregious.  If the arrest warrant was faulty or erroneous, and the service of the warrant resulted in additional evidence being seized as a result of the arrest, then there may be suppression issues.  General information in a public forum is obviously no substitute for advice of counsel in a confidential setting, after review of all the facts, as an attorney can best review all evidence and determine any defenses."

1824514,"Probably not. Generally the type of background check the apartment complex is looking at is a credit check, and this kind of info isn't going to be there.  Employers in Alabama we access to  something known as the Alabama Criminal Justice Information System, ACJIS for short.  This system would disclose that there is warrant outstanding, but landlords don't have access to it.  The landlord  might be able to look you up on the court system's online database called ""Alacourt.""  But this system doesn't cover all courts, and it would be cumbersome and expensive, so I doubt they have that.  What you really need to worry about is your driver's license.  Generally, Alabama will suspend your driver's license if you fail to appear for a traffic ticket.  If you have a license from a different state your license will ultimately be suspended as well....it might take a while, but you will be suspended.  If you are already suspended, this might give you trouble in getting an apartment.  It will also be an impediment to driving around town!     Here's how you can take care of that ticket:  Get a lawyer in the city or county where you got the ticket.  (You knew I was going to say that, didn't you?)  The lawyer will find whether you can take care of a ticket without appearing and how much it will cost.  Even if you have to appear, the lawyer can probably arrange this so that you won't have to waste away in jail waiting on the judge to let you out.  Now, it this was a serious traffic ticket...say a DUI or something, it will be more difficult.  But you really need to resolve this ticket."

At that hearing, you must present evidence -- including your marriage certificate -- to support what you've stated in your Complaint.  You must also have a witness to corroborate your claims.     After you present your evidence,  the court will issue its findings and recommendations, which are then incorporated into the divorce decree.

If it is all yours then it will naturally pass to your son if he is your only heir. If you have multiple heirs you need to address this issue in your will.  2. B. If it is not yours when you pass and instead goes to someone else, then you are likely limited on what you can pass down to your son.  2. C. If you keep it as long as you pay taxes on it then okay, but what happens if you do not pay the taxes (i am not referring to sheriff sale - i am asking if there are terms in the document that indicate it passes to someone else?).   If it is yours free and clear, you don't necessarily need to have your name on the deed, but it would be helpful to do so while you are alive and will make future transfers easier. Consult with your attorney about placing it into your name as soon as possible (have the attorney draft a new deed ASAP and have it signed (by the necessary party), or having it placed directly in your son's name immediately while you are alive.   If it is yours with conditions, make sure you talk with your son first as he may not be in a position to pay taxes on the property. You don't want to cause a burden on someone unless they are agreeable to it.   These are all questions you can start asking your attorney.   I wish you a positive outcome."

Most of the time the judge assumes that it is correct and accurately shows what was agreed to.  Your husband has the right to the benefit of his bargain. The agreement appears in other places in the plea paperwork. I would start by looking at the confession of the motion to revoke. If the judgment and sentence says something different than what is on his confession it can be amended sometimes by agreement. If it is merely a scrivner's error, the judgment and sentence nunc pro tunc can be done relatively easily. I am concerned about your question because judgment and sentences are filled out according to years and days not percentages of the year. That leads me to believe that what you are describing is what your husband was told he would serve out of the days and the years that he was sentenced to."

Your claim will depend on your particular sequence of facts, especially regarding reporting and notice of your injuries. Workers Compensation timelines are shorter than regular negligence-based injury claims in Missouri, so do not wait. Many attorneys who handle Workers Compensation claims will discuss this matter with you at no charge to explore the options available to you. If you have a claim, the attorneys fees come out of the recovery money, so you need not concern yourself with paying an attorney anything out-of-pocket to process your claim. Good Luck."

With the economy like it was four years ago, a lot of people had to make tough decisions about what to do with the little money they had.   2) If you have been served with a new lawsuit, you should definitely not ignore it.  After four years, it is possible that the company that is suing you is not the company that loaned you the money (what we call a ""debt buyer"").  These cases are defensible.  You should not just assume that you are going to lose.    3) I recommend that you speak with an experienced consumer debt-defense attorney.  Do not worry that you feel that you do not have money for attorney fees.  Most consumer firms will offer a telephone consultation and a limited document review (by scan/email or fax) at no cost to the consumer.    4) You need to have your concerns addressed by an attorney that can speak with you to get more details.  You may have less to worry about than you think.  (For example, I have never seen a consumer collection attorney ever take anyone's house.)"

1817340,"At-will employment is a doctrine in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason without having to establish ""just cause"" for termination, and without warning.  The basis for this rule is that an employee may be similarly entitled to leave his or her job without reason or warning.  This includes work hours, pay, policies and job assignments.     In workplaces with a trade union and a collective bargaining agreement, if you have an employment contract, and in many public sector jobs, the normal standard for dismissal is that the employer must have a ""just cause"".  Otherwise, subject to statutory rights, such as protections against discrimination and/or retaliation, the general principle is that an employee may be discharged without cause and without notice.  If you believe that you are being discriminated against or retaliated against because you are a member of a protected category, you might benefit from consulting with an experienced employment law attorney and having them evaluate your case.

If the promissory note has an attorney fees clause, you can sue for the amount owed plus costs of suit and attorney fees (assuming you hire a lawyer to represent you).  You might want to write a demand letter to the borrower, reminding him or her that one or more payments have been missed and demanding the past due amounts.

Bundling is slightly more risky since one brand may not want to be associated with perceived inferior brands in that way. However, with mixing like you propose, you become the ultimate consumer since after you get through the product is not the original product so it cannot be reverse passing off.

1825040,"Overtime EXEMPT salaried employees generally must be paid their full salary unless they miss or or more FULL workdays due to illness or personal reasons.  Otherwise, the employer loses the benefit of the exemption and becomes liable for overtime.  An overtime exempt employee could not have PTO deducted for a partial day absence without compromising their exemption because they are already entitled to the full day's pay and so the PTO deduction is essentially a PTO forfeiture, which would be unlawful.  Non-exempt salaried employees, on the other hand, can generally have their salaries reduced for partial day absences if there is an agreement to that effect with the employer.  Really, this sort of arrangement is more akin to hourly pay, since the employee's compensation is determined by the total number of hours they work.  Nonetheless, since a non-exempt employee's ""salary"" can be reduced for partial day absences, there is nothing unlawful about requiring the employee to use PTO to fill in the hours they didn't work."
1825625,"Contract law in Washington is specifically modified and restricted in residential tenancies. There are statutes that control how the contract can work. There are restrictions. See RCW 59 18 230, for example. If you were considering renting out the place to a tenant who is really a complete flake, and you did not follow the rules about taking their money, return the money and thank your lucky stars you get a new opportunity to screen a prospective tenant. There are companies that do this for you. You can make the tenant pay the cost of screening - provided you do so properly.   Most landlords I represent get a contract from a store or off the internet, and then the landlord believes that the tenant is obligated according to the terms of the rental contract. This is not true. It would save you untold grief and aggravation to have a consult with a local, well-regarded landlord tenant attorney so you get started correctly, rather than waiting to get sued because you feel you want to save money.   The penalty for taking a deposit incorrectly can be as much as two times the deposit, pre-judgment interest at 12% from the date you took the money, and ALL the tenant's reasonable attorney fees incurred getting their money back.

1822563,"Thank you for your question!  Ok, first off, did the subs provide you with any request to withhold the statutory retainage?  Basically, you have to withhold 10 percent of the total cost owed to the contractor, to cover the subs.  If you did not get any sort of document regarding this, you don't have to withhold that amount of money.  If you do get it, however, and you completely pay off the contractor, the subs can put a lien on your homestead.  This is one of the few ways that people can put a lien on your homestead, without your express permission.  So, have these subs given you written notice to withhold the money?  Simply because they have told you of the issue, doesn't mean anything, really.  Also, did they tell you in writing?  OR did they simply call you?  They are required to file an affidavit of lien and then serve both you and the contractor.  Basically, if there is nothing written that has been given to you, then you should be fine.  However, feel free to tell the contractor, that to protect your own interests, you will not be paying him the remainder of the money, until he has paid his subcontractors.  Also, there are VERY strict timelines that must be followed, to make any of this stick.  I have written a guide for subcontractors and contractors on my profile, that lays those out.  Hope this helps!"
1811601,You need to get to a probate lawyer.  Probate in Az requires specific notice to interested parties  and heirs. You should have been given notice. You should have also received an Inventory and Appraisement and other documents before the estate assets were distributed.   You apparently had notice that something was going on so the clock for taking action may already be ticking. There are time limits in which to take action so you should seek advice from a probate lawyer as soon as possible.

Learn your options and get fee quotes. Generally, at the first court date, the Court will ask if you are going to hire an attorney. while most likely punishment won't be severe, this is the kind of charge (especially with a conviction) that can follow you for a long time and have impact on future employment opportunities. Talk to an attorney. Good luck"

This is exactly what you've done.  Sometimes people get confused when the law uses the word ""service"" because it is often associated with service of process which requires a disinterested party.  However, most often, when a law or rule mentions ""service"" it means a less stringent standard where delivering it yourself is perfectly fine."

1807403,"Creditors can't usually just seize assets, so they would have to file a lawsuit to gain title to the asset.  The answer thus depends on where your LLC is doing business. If you are doing business only in FL (since it will own real property in FL), then the LLC would have to be sued in FL. Conversely, if the LLC is doing business in CA  it could be sued in CA.  Because members of an LLC do not have personal liability for the company's debts (generally), your state of residence really doesn't matter in the case of a lawsuit.   If you personally guarantee a debt of the LLC, then the creditor could go after you in CA or wherever you live.   For cases involving real property, the general rule is that the proper jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the real property is located.     Once the creditor has a judgment, it will eventually end up in FL where the assets are located in order to enforce the judgment and collect assets of the LLC.   If the judgment is from a CA court, it could be entered in FL as a sister-state judgment and then enforced there."

1829919,"Since you are apparently referencing ""summary judgment,"" this makes me believe that you are in US District Court.  If so and if a motion for summary judgment has been granted by the Judge, then you will likely have a difficult time getting this reversed.  If I am correct and you are already in federal court, then you certainly need to have a lawyer if you didn't already have one.  In any event, you need to sit down with an attorney and fully review the situation in person to determine your best course of action.  Appeals beyond US District Court for SSA claims are rarely successful but we have absolutely no facts here to evaluate and maybe your case is the exception.

The DA will use police testimony, 911 calls, neighbor witnesses, medical evidence and testimony, photos, video, prior statements made to the police, and any other evidence at their disposal to try and prove their case.  So to summarize no it does not mean the case will be dismissed."
1786986,"The answer from the Missouri attorney is more correct.   The differences in the answers shows the differences in state laws. For non payment of rent cases, Missouri has no formal notice, or notice period, requirement.  If the rent is not paid, the landlord is permitted to file their action.  The tenant is permitted to pay the rent in full and defeat the possessory portion of the case. If a landlord wishes to terminate the tenancy, without tenant's opportunity to pay, THEN the landlord must give some sort of notice -- the kind and time period are determined by the authority under which the landlord is acting -- statutory or contract. As an answer to the question, if rent is due, without regard to the amount of time it is outstanding or promises to pay, then you can file a rent and possession case.  The amounts actually due might come into question  when determining the ""work v. rent due"" issues."

However, I will say that if you put multiple ""websites"" (small businesses) all under the roof of a single LLC, you put each website at risk for liabilities incurred for the others.

If you have been married for less than 2 years, then you will receive a green card that is valid for 2 years and you will be a ""conditional"" permanent resident.  Regarding citizenship, if you do not have any other claim to U.S. Citizenship or naturalization, then you must first become a permanent resident before you are eligible to apply for naturalization.

You can also try to simply submit a stipulated modification to the court, but if the county is involved, they'll have to sign off on it as well.  It might be faster to simply have the hearing."

However, once you are named, you could somehow end up with a judgment which appears in your name, which could affect your credit rating.

First, you & your husband should not be waiting for so much time for an answer from USCIS. All of my permanent residency cases wherein a US citizen spouse (the sponsoring spouse CAN be a permanent resident but must become a US citizen before the beneficiary spouse is approved for permanent residency) files to sponsor his/her spouse have been approved on the very same day. The longest I've ever had to wait was a few weeks for the approval.  You should make an appointment via InfoPass to find out what has happened. However, I have another idea but I prefer to not discuss that via this website.  But if you & your husband are considering divorcing, YES it will affect you since you have not been approved yet. I have handled these situations before both on Long Island AND in New York City (26 Federal Plaza).  In fact, based on these facts, you will never receive either permanent residency OR conditional permanent residency if you & husband divorce now.  "

On the other hand, heirlooms can have such significant emotional value that people are willing to spend far more than the monetary value of the heirloom to litigate over them.  From your fact pattern, if I was your lawyer, I would take the position that the heirloom was gifted to your mother.  It was a completed gift and now it passes to her children.  It does not go to her sister.  I am sorry for your loss of your mother and wish you the best of luck."

1810169,"The law isn't clear regarding residences.  It says  that places of employment and jails are not required to accommodate usage,  however it is silent as to residences.   The law allows you to have up to 6 plants,  so I think that an argument could be made that a landlord has to accommodate usage.   However,  there isn't any specific law saying that.  I have linked to the Health and Safety Codes with the Medical Marijuana Act.  Section 11362.77 covers growing plants,  and Section 11362.785 deals with employment and jails.   In order to avoid problems,  I would bring it up with your landlord.  If anything, plants would help you pay your rent so there is a benefit to the landlord."

1829254,"A drug test is an invasion of your medical privacy unless it is done under specific legal procedures and only in certain circumstances.  First, you can be subjected to truly random drug testing if the employer has a published procedure notifying you of such and the test is done in a manner that protects the privacy interests of the employee, both in the manner in which the test is administered and in how the results are maintained.  Second, you can be subject to a reasonable suspicion drug test if the employer has a published procedure notifying you of such and the employer has sufficient reasonable suspicion to give it the right to specifically test you.  Reasonable suspicion must be more than speculation.  The code defines several factors that could constitute reasonable suspicion.  With this kind of test, again, the test must be done in a manner that protects the privacy interests of the employee, both in the manner in which the test is administered and in how the results are maintained.  Third, you can be subjected to a post-accident drug test if the employer has a published procedure notifying you of such and you have very recently been involved in some kind of workplace accident.     Also with this kind of test the test must be done in a manner that protects the privacy interests of the employee, both in the manner in which the test is administered and in how the results are maintained.  If you believe your privacy has been invaded based on the above explanation it would be prudent for you to locate and consult with an experienced employment law attorney as soon as possible to explore your facts and determine your options.  I would suggest you look either on this site in the Find a Lawyer section, or go to www.cela.org, the home page for the California Employment Lawyers Association, an organization whose members are dedicated to the representation of employees against their employers.  Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you. Many advance all the costs of the litigation as well. Do not let fear of fees and costs keep you from finding a good attorney.  Good luck to you."
1826121,"Mr. Thompson is correct in suggesting your daughter consider a Bankruptcy filing.

1812236,"Expungements do not reach FBI records--but you do not have a guilty finding, conviction, or anything other than a history of having been charged, and the fact that the charges were later dismissed.  Unless you were taken into custody by the police and transported to the police station before being charged and released, you were not ""arrested"".  Most shoplifting charges in Maryland result in the issuance of a criminal citation and/or a summons to appear at court, not by way of an actual arrest.  The record check will not show why the charge was dropped, so the fact that you did community service in exchange for that is not something they will know.  You are innocent until proven guilty, and in this case, the prosecutor's office dropped all charges and you remain innocent of this charge (in the eyes of the law).  My guess is, the real reason you were not hired was because you LIED on the application in response to the question about ever being charged with a criminal offense.  You were charged, but the charges were dismissed before trial.  That's how you should answer that question.  As far as you are concerned, you would have won the trial and been found not guilty of the charge had the case gone forward.  Lying on an application is worse than having a minor criminal charge which was dismissed.  It is also a felony to lie on a federal application for employment.  In the future, with respect to any federal employment, read the question on the application carefully, and disclose the fact that you were charged or accused of a crime if that is specified."

You would have no remaining debts as to these properties.  ‰Û¢ Considering my income, is there any chance for me to pay off portion of my credit cards debt or I will need to pay off entire amount of debt via chapter 13?  A chapter 13 repayment plan is based on what you can afford to pay each month after meeting your necessary expenses.  The percentage that gets paid to your unsecured creditors varies depending on your income, expenses and total debt.  ‰Û¢ Is Chapter 13 good to save a property, which is not my case?  A chapter 13 can be a good strategy to help homeowners catch up on delinquent mortgage payments over time if s/he can afford the current payments in addition to catching up on the arrears.  However, chapter 13 can also be a good option for people who are not interested in saving secured property, but do not qualify for a chapter 7.  ‰Û¢ Can I simply negotiate pay off terms/amount directly with credit card‰Ûªs creditors and avoid chapter 13 procedures?  You could certainly try to, but it would require a great deal of coordination and cooperation with your creditors and may possibly still leave you with more debt to pay than you can afford."
1826044,"You should seek an attorney who can explain all of your options.  It is best if you and your husband can agree to a settlement ahead of the final divorce, but that is not always possible.  In the end, if you and your husband are not able to agree, the attorneys will advocate for what you want as far as alimony, custody, and visitation matters.  It will be costly and may extend the divorce proceedings if a judge has to decide these matters for you both.  I suggest mediation as a way to come to a settlement so that you both can move forward."

If you want to take issue with the process, you can file a petition to the court alerting them to the issues and asking them to order remedies, depending on the stage of the probate administration.  It is possible the court will say that there were errors; however, they were immaterial and do nothing.  It is also possible that the court will rule that the errors are problematic and start the entire probate process over.  Or it‰Ûªs possible the court will have PR merely fix the errors with the probate by completing specific tasks.  An initial consultation with local counsel is a good way to determine what your rights and what benefits could result if you choose to move forward with this matter."

He will have the ability to either get a bond or request a bond once in ICE custody. However, if he is convicted of the DV his bond in immigration will be a lot higher. His bond in immigration can be at least $1,500 or higher typically between $5,000 to $10,000. It has to be paid in a lump sum unless you use an immigration bail bondsman. Best of luck."

On its face, as you are the ""monied"" spouse, you are likely to face a maintenance order (they do not call it alimony, anymore).  In the court's determination, they will factor in the fact that he quit his job two years ago, was unemployed for a year, and took a job earning substantially less.

1811384,"I would never advise anyone to leave their home.  If you do, there is a good argument that you should not be awarded exclusive possession of the marital home as there is no need for it.  I would advise that you file for a divorce and ask to be awarded temporary possession pending a final hearing.  Of course, you should speak with an attorney immediately to be sure you do what is best for your upcoming case.  Keep in mind that most attorneys do not charge for a consultation.  This would give you the opportunity to discuss a strategy that would work best for your situation.  Good luck."

1809234,"As someone who has been representing injured workers in workers' compensation disputes in Pinellas and Pasco County since 1985, I think Mr. Schwartz has hit the nail on the head.  A lot, although not all, of the workers' compensation laws are substantive laws meaning that they apply only to certain dates of accident. When you say the settlement was reached years ago, I presume that you mean you settled your rights to workers' compensation disability money benefits but that settlement left open your rights to workers' compensation medical care benefits.  Florida law changed effective January 1, 1994 to allow workers' compensation settlement to settle the right to future medical care in addition to the right to future money disability benefits.  Prior to that time, a claimant (injured worker) was not allowed to settle his right to future medical care benefits even if he wanted to.  Effective January 1, 1994 and again October 1, 2003, the Florida workers' compensation laws changed the burden for the claimant to prove what medical benefits he was entitled to.  Your burden is easier if your workers' compensation accident was before October 1, 2003 and especially if it was before January 1, 1994.  Like Mr. Schwartz said, I suggest you contact an experienced workers' compensation attorney who has experience with Florida workers' compensation cases under the laws as they existed in the late 1980s throughout the 1990s.  A good place to start to find the right attorney is here on Avvo."

Generally speaking, however, you will be able to have a share of any property (with a few exceptions) that was obtained during the marriage, you may qualify for alimony/spousal support, and if you get custody of your daughter and she is still a minor you can get child support.  Depending on what else is going on and a lot of information you didn't provide, there are many other things which might apply to your situation as well.  Go see someone"

If you hear from him or the police, you should not speak to them but consult an attorney before you move forward.  Good luck."

1794535,"Sacramento does not have a rent control ordinance.  Therefore, theoretically there is no limit to the amount the landlord can increase your rent.  However, the increase would only be valid for a month to month tenancy or less, or for example where your lease is expiring in 30 days.   It's important to note that even if you're on month to month tenancy,  the landlord cannot raise the rent in retaliation for some action you took like making a legitimate complaint or for legally withholding rent.  Moreover, the landlord can't raise the rent as a discriminatory action.  If you suspect that you have been retaliated or discriminated against as a result of the increase, speak to attorney as soon as a possible."

The nasty consequences of such an order will include having to report two or three times a year to DHS, having to get a EAD (work permit) every year, and only getting a drivers' license corresponding to the dates on that EAD.  My advice is to seek the services of an experienced immigration attorney to straighten out your situation.  Good luck."

Give the lawyer a chance to explain what he is doing and why.   Please remember, just because you don't see your lawyer does not mean that he/she isn't working on your case. Once you have had that discussion and can determine whether the lawyer is right for you, then you can decide to discharge that lawyer or not. But please remember, lawyers bill for their time.   If you retain a new lawyer, that lawyer will have to spend billable hours just to become familiar with the case.  That might or might not be in your best interest.

1813565,"You cannot become the trustee of a trust unless the instrument says so.  Hopefully you and your mother were on good terms, but trusts are sometimes set up for the express purpose of not allowing people to find out what is in them, especially people who the Grantor wanted to exclude, reduce or restrict.  Unlike Wills, which are public documents after probate, trusts are private.  On the ""plus"" side, if you are a beneficiary, and if the trusts are ""irrevocable"", you can get your distribution immediately, and without estate tax.  I have found that you can usually get copies of trusts by politely asking the estate attorney for copies.  If the attorney refuses, or ignores your request, you would want to hire your own attorney.  But if you can get what you want by asking nicely, it could save you some money."

It may, possibly, be that they are issuing the payment towards your expense in renting a car to replace yours while it is being repaired?  I raise this possibility as your question implies that the total repair costs significantly exceed $260.00, correct?  Even assuming that the payment is towards your repair costs, your negotiation of the check likely will not serve as a release of your claim - it is fairly rare in my experience that release language is included on a check of this sort.  Of course, you will want to read the language on the check before depositing or cashing it."

1793336,"Your question is a confusing --- if the manufacturer has a license to use the photo, then it can use the photo. I assume from the tenor of your question that the manufacturer is selling its product on the retailers' websites, and the photo is in some way used for an ad that touts the manufacturer's product, which would seem to be a legitimate use. Again, however, any lawyer looking at this issue is going to have to have specific facts about the relationships, and review the licensing agreement.   If it's only a $1400 claim, you might be best served by continuing to send in the letter that worked for the other 4 retailers (i.e., every time you get the generic claim letter, drop your standard response letter back in the mail to the copyright holder). It's unlikely anyone is going to take action over a $1400 claim."
1823043,"The facts aren't quite clear to me.  If you gave her a standard notice to vacate (and my understanding is that it is not necessarily 30 days in Washington) and the tenant truly has a disability that reasonably requires a longer move-out period, then you may or may not have difficulty getting a court to uphold your termination of tenancy notice.  If however the tenant gave you notice with a specific date, that should be fully enforceable and not subject to the tenant later changing their mind.  Either way, you have a right to receive rent for however long they are in possession without having to touch the security deposit.  The issue, however, is if you accept rent for past the notice's move out date, you may waive your right to evict pursuant to the notice.  So all told, you may well want to review the entire matter with a local landlord-tenant attorney before doing anything further.  It can be very expensive to try to evict her but get it wrong.  Good luck."

Three months is well under the standard processing time. Use this time to hire an attorney, gather additional evidence and prepare for your interview."
1817754,"Can a veteran file a claim for injuries suffered as a result of malpractice at the VA?  Yes.  There are two potential avenues of recovery.  If the physician was an ""independent contractor"" and NOT a federal employee then that physician can usually be sued under the laws of the state where the treatment occurred.  If the negligent doctor or health care providers WERE federal employees, then you cannot sue in state court, you must bring a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act.    I do not know the law regarding medical malpractice in SC, but there are most certainly deadlines to file a claim in state court.  Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, however, you have to file Form 95 within two years from the date you knew (or should have known) that malpractice injured your husband.  Once that form is filed, the U.S. has six months to either pay your claim or deny it.  If they deny the claim, or if six months passes without a response, you can file suit in Federal Court.  The more complicated question is whether or not your husband's Arachnoiditis was caused by negligence.  That can only be answered by a qualified physician who has the time to conduct a thorough review of your husband's medical records and radiology studies.  Arachnoiditis can certainly be caused by improper medical care.  Some surgeons, however, will say that it can result from surgery even if the surgeon provided perfect medical care.  Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."

If she wanted to push the issue, she'd have to file suit in small claims court which would cost her time and money.

So unless you feel like giving her the dog back is the right thing to do (and if you do, I'd get your $200 back first), you can tell her to pound sand."

1821578,"In almost all but the truly unusual defamation case, in which public figures are involved, or the damages are clear and quite substantial, lawyers accept these cases on an hourly rate basis, as opposed to a contingency fee. The obvious result is that the client spends significant funds for the lawyer to spend significant time in assembling the evidence and trying the case. In addition, most insurance policies do not cover intentional acts (such as libel or slander), and thus the defendant usually is someone or some entity that must have substantial assets, in order to satisfy any potential compensatory/punitive damages award.

1811939,"You certainly are free to make whatever decision is best for you and your family here, if you are unable to make mortgage payments due to financial circumstances, no one should judge you for that. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. Since you've already filed bankruptcy, your personal liability has been discharged, and therefore the only connection the lender has to you is the mortgage lien on the property. If you discontinue mortgage payments (for whatever reason), the lender will eventually foreclose. The non-judicial (most common) foreclosure process in California can take a year or longer. Your credit has already been damaged by the bankruptcy, I don't believe the foreclosure or short sale makes it significantly worse. I disagree that you won't be able to rent. If you are willing to show your prospective landlord bank statements and paystubs demonstrating you make sufficient income, and you explain the situation, most landlords still consider tenants with damaged credit. If you are willing to offer a little extra security deposit, you enhance your chances even more. If you wanted to be more in control of the process, you should do a short sale on the property which would function similarly to a typical real estate transaction, except the lender has to approve the ""loss."""

1782917,"The proper jurisdiction (Court) to determine child custody is usually the place where the child has lived the past six months.  That being said, if your son comes to Missouri, you may be able to get the Missouri Court to make a custody decision based on either the emergency need for a custody determination or on the fact that your ex has ""unclean hands"" because she abducted the child.    Even though you are on his birth certificate you should seek to establish paternity and custody through a court order as soon as possible because the court will consider continuity of life in your son's best interests and the longer he stays in Florida the harder it may be to get him back.    You may also want to request copies of the court documents giving your ex's father guardianship from the Florida court where they were issued.

As for the civil demand letter, hopefully you did not pay it. Please read: There is a law in the state of Illinois which allows for civil action collection when there is a retail theft. Most people choose to ignore the demand. This demand is for money over and above any fine you pay in compliance with a court order. People may get a few more letters, each time asking for more, and then they stop. While the retailer can sue you, it is extremely rare for anyone to actually be sued. You do not owe any money unless you are sued and the retailer wins. This is a common ploy. Do not pay. If you do, you will be in the national retailers database which could affect your ability to get a job and could impact your life in other ways. If you are uncomfortable, hire a lawyer and have the lawyer write a letter. That should be the end of it.   Here is a good article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120347031996578...   The National Retail Theft Database is actually a voluntary list put together by different individual retailers. Further, any member that published the information on the list, can thereafter, remove it.

Moreover, circulating among managerial staff an employee evaluation made by a manager is legally the employer communicating the statements to itself. Managers are not 3rd parties for purposes of meeting the publication element required for defamation claims.   There is no falsity of the evaluation proven by the fact that the manager used your work. Businesses often use (or start with) low quality work in constructing deliverables for the customer. Nor is falsity proven by the fact that the customer agreed with your work. That's just one more opinion.   You don't have anything near a sound defamation claim here, I am sorry to say.

I suggest you use an immigration attorney with experience doing I-751's with marriages that break up quickly.  If you soon to be ex-spouse is cooperative, you can make a very strong case.  There are even things you can do in the divorce documents to strengthen your proof that you had a bona fide marriage.  I have known such I-751's to be approved without even an interview.  Given the magnitude of the problem you will have if the I-751 is not approved, I suggest you use an attorney.  And, don't wait until next year.

Most employment attorneys who practice this area of law work on a contingency basis, meaning you can hire an attorney without paying any money until the matter results in a positive outcome for you.  Many advance all the costs of the litigation as well.  Do not let fear of fees and costs keep you from finding a good attorney.  Good luck to you."
1789263,"In Las Vegas on felony or gross misdemeanor charges, a standard condition of probation is to be employed full time (or be looking for work) and when you're not employed full time, do community service (usually 16 hours per month).  If you're disabled, maybe you can't work or do community service.  It sounds like you have a lawyer working to get you disability benefits, but that process can take some time, and until that goes through your PO is going to give you a hard time about not fulfilling the conditions of your probation.  Any time you're arguably violating your probation, you are subject to arrest and revocation.  So if you can, have a criminal defense attorney file a motion to modify the terms and conditions of probation and be prepared to provide the court with proof of your disability.  According to NRS 176A.400, the judge who sentenced you can modify the terms of your probation at any time.

1816918,"Attorneys are not supposed to solicit business when responding to questions on Avvo. So you should not receive an offer to represent you based on this question. I would recommend that you use the ""Find a Lawyer"" section to locate an attorney that handles Social Security Claims in your area (http://www.avvo.com/search/lawyer_search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Social+Security&loc=bakersfield%2C+ca&commit=). Once you find an attorney that you would like to potentially hire, call their phone number for more information, or use the email link to email them.   Most attorneys for Social Security Disability offer representation on a contingency fee basis with a free initial consultation. That means that you do not have to pay money to speak with them initially, and you do not have to pay to hire them. Contingency means that the attorney only receives a percentage of your past-due benefits if you are approved by Social Security. Past-due benefits are only those benefits from the initial date you are determined to be eligible for benefits until the date that you are approved (nothing out of monthly benefits).  Since you got an 827 in the mail, that would lead me to believe for some reason you have an active claim pending (maybe you started an application on Social Security's Website: www.ssa.gov). It is important that the 827 is sent in as soon as possible or your claim can be denied. An attorney will likely have a way of contacting the Social Security Administration to get information about your current claim status. Since you were denied benefits in the past, they can also explain the process in greater detail and help explain the types of information that you need this time to have a better chance of being approved.  I would highly recommend that you contact an attorney for help immediately. Good luck!"

1817653,"People are often prosecuted for what seems like small roles in drug conspiracy cases.  Co-conspirators are often on the hook for the entire conspiracy.  Especially in federal court, the penalties for drug conspiracy cases can be very high.  It would be inherently suspicious to an investigatory that you rented a car for someone who is found transporting drugs.  I would be hiring an attorney now, at least to consult on ways to put this fire out before it fans into flames."
1824878,"From your description, none of your acts appear to amount to either libel or harassment. So long as what you have stated in your post is what happened, and likewise what you posted, there is nothing either false about your statement, nor an attempt at harassment."
1814997,You need to discuss this case with an attorney to decide which option would be better for you: either attempting to modify the decree or seking damages from the lawyer.
1790526,"First and foremost, do not answer any questions from law enforcement and hire a criminal defense attorney. The employment issue is very secondary to the criminal issue. Clearly, the employer has reason to believe your husband committed a crime. By most accounts, getting arrested, charged with a crime and jailed is far more concerning than losing his job at this point.  If no charges are brought and he is not reinstated, at that point, you may wish to consult an employment attorney.  Good luck!"
1791616,"If by agent you are referring to a probation officer, filing a compkaint will not get you what you want, which is peace and protection from the person you state is harassing you.  Have you called the police?  Try calling the police rather than the probation officer."
1797051,"Probably not, as there is a litigation privilege (Civil Code section 47) that generally applies to protect such statements as long as they were made in good faith.  Naturally, I trust you believe they were not made in good faith.  That is a very tough challenge to meet.  Moreover, there is an anti-SLAPP (Slapp is strategic lawsuit about public process) at Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 that would be a defense to the other parties.  Beware on suing on such a claim, as the prevailing party asserting an anti-SLAPP defense is entitled to attorney fees.  Be careful."
1814309,"I am not clear whether or not the debt is related to the truck or just your own personal debt.   Any property you own once a judgment is issued could be subject to a creditor's efforts to collect on the judgment.  A jointly owned asset like your truck is going to be problematic for the creditor because the creditor has no claim against your girlfriend so I am not sure whether or not the creditor could levy against the truck in this situation.   But what I can tell you is that even if the creditor could levy on your 1/2 interest and order the truck sold, the creditor would be faced with paying your exempt amount that Oregon allows for a vehicle to you, which is about $3,000 just for your 1/2 interest.  So unless the truck is worth substantially more than $6,000 a creditor is not going to want to touch your truck.   (I am assuming that there is no secured vehicle loan that would also need to be paid - if there is a loan against the truck add the principle balance of the loan to $6,000.00 and that will be the number that the creditor will have to beat to net any profit.   Also there will be some expense involved in selling the car so add another $1,000 as the estimate of the sales cost.)  If the truck is held jointly with a right of survivorship, a creditor is not going to want to wait around to see if you die first and by that time the truck may have no value.  The best think to do is consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney as soon as you can.  The federal exemptions that you can use in a bankruptcy proceeding are more generous then the Oregon exemptions. so through a bankruptcy you can cancel out your debt and probably still keep a car worth far for then you would in the above example.  A bankruptcy  you do alone shouldn't effect your girlfriends interest in the truck or any other property she has in her name as long as you didn't recently transfer property to her for less then fair market value.  The federal bankruptcy exemption rules, that can now be elected in Oregon bankruptcies, allow you to exempt $3,675 for a motor vehicle but you can also add on a general exemption of $1,225 plus $11,500 of an unused homestead exemption if you don't own a home that needs this exemption.  So in theory you could exempt a car that your 1/2 interest is worth as much as $16,400."
1596620,"More important than the injury being 20 years ago is when were benefits last paid.  It is possible that a claim of that age is still open bot not if not benefits have been paid in 20 years.  I suggest you call a workers comp lawyer, give him your claim number and he can very easily tell you if it is possible to get additional benefits under that claim.  I suggest you do not delay.

Civilians (and many cops!) are usually not trained in the federal standards for field sobreity tests NHTSA FST's. so there is no way for your friends to know whether or not you performed well on the tests.   As a NHTSA certified SFST Instuctor, I can tell you that the tests are highly subjective. Your friends could give testimony about your overall appearance and maybe a disconnect between your alleged BAC and your presentation that night.   Bottom line: You need a skilled and qualified DUI lawyer to fight to get your the best possible results. Since most of us on AVVO will give you a free consultation, you have nothing to lose by calling around now!!"

1810731,"If you're already on SSDI (and not SSI), then you don't need an attorney for this.  Just go down to your local Social Security office and tell them you want to file applications for ""auxiliary benefits"" for your kids.  Typically, a disabled person's children receive, together, about half of what the disabled person receives, no matter how many kids there are.  So if your benefit is $1,000 per month, and you have one child, that child will likely get a benefit of around $500 per month (on top of your own benefit).  If the same person has two kids under age 18, each will likely receive around $250 (for a total of $500)."

Some of the factors which may be considered by the court include whether you have been the primary active participant in the children's lives and involved in all aspects of their development, whether you have encouraged and supervised your children's relationship with their friends and the extent to which you have prepared the children's meals, scheduled their doctor and dental appointments, attended teacher conferences, helped with homework and enrolled and transported the children to their activities."
1793166,A consultation would be required before a fee can be quoted. A waiver is very fact specific on a case-by-case basis. The first question is whether you qualify. A consultation with an experienced immigration attorney would be well worth your time and investment.

1821151,"If you are over the age of 21 this charge will not suspend your license. Also, you are not going to jail for this. The Municipal Court of Atlanta is not the best place to dispose of super speeder tickets. I recommend binding the case over to The State Court of Fulton County. It takes 12 to 18 months for the case to reach Fulton, but they will most likely reduce your speed so you will not get the super speeder fine, and the charge will not go on your driving history.  It may be possible to get the ticket dismissed in Fulton."
1809687,"To be blunt, you have two options -- fix the marriage or get divorced within the next 12-15 months.  In order to get your permanent green card at the end of the two years, you need to have your wife be ""on board"" and jointly applying with you, and you would need to be living with her.  OR, if you are already divorced, you can petition by yourself and just prove that the marriage was genuine while it lasted.   If you're living apart but not yet divorced when you apply for the permanent green card, it will be nearly impossible to succeed."
1798493,"If you are able to agree to a settlement, the debt collector will generally have a standard agreement as well.  Generally they will provide a settlement in full letter.  This letter alone is good enough for you to avoid future liability (lawsuits, etc.) on the debt.  However, if it is a full settlement and release you are looking for, which I doubt they will sign if the amount is as insignificant as you say), you can use that language in your search engine.  Although it already appears that you have all the general necessities covered here."

1784378,"Even though the language of CCP 998 says ""allow judgment to be entered"" the common practice is to ""settle"" these cases rather than letting a judgment be entered.   Demand in writing from your insurance company to settle the cases within your policy limits. Should they fail to do so, any excess judgment will be the insurance company's obligation to pay. Additionally, you may have a case against your carrier for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   You should get a lawyer, and I'm not talking about the one that was assigned to you by your carrier."

At that time, you should contact a qualified attorney to assist in the preparation of the petition and the hearing.  Good luck."
1811787,"An employer violates the law when it requires you  to work beyond the physical restrictions placed upon you by your doctor.  You can refuse to work beyond those restrictions or, if you choose to work beyond those restrictions and you are further injured by that, you can assert liability against the employer for those further injuries, and there would be no workers compensation exclusivity that would force you to address those workplace injuries in the workers compensation system.  Instead, you can sue for your injuries as a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act and there would be no limitation on the damages you can assert as there would be in the workers compensation system.  Your options are therefore few:  One, you can continue to work beyond your restrictions as long as you continue to inform the employer that doing so is in violation of those restrictions, and see what happens.  Two, you can refuse to work beyond your restrictions.  If you do and you are harassed or retaliated against for doing so, and the employer could reasonably accommodate your restrictions as stated by your doctor, then you would have a claim for violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and perhaps a wrongful termination claim if you are fired.  Third, you can hire an attorney to write a demand letter for you indicating what will happen if they continue to engage in the conduct you have posted about.  This might make them follow the law.  If you are retaliated against for standing up for your rights in this way, it would be unlawful.  The issue would be whether you could prove it to be retaliation.  Good luck to you."

1800441,"Based on the facts presented, you may have a claim under Section 1981 and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. You may want to consult with an employment attorney to get more information of what rights and remedies may be available to you. However, you will need to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.  This means you will have to establish through direct or circumstantial evidence that you were not promoted because of you are black or African American. You will first need to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. I hope this information is helpful."
1802615,"Remember that you have not gotten married in order to get the immigration benefit. That's fraud. You are married because that's what you want. You make life choices because that is what you want. You can show immigration that your lives are hopelessly commingled and that it would take a clever family lawyer to untangle them.... because that is what you want.  If they sent you an RFE it is that they (sitting in an office a thousand miles away) weren't convinced by what you sent them. Before you change your life to please immigration - which might show that you are doing it to please immigration - go take your RFE and copies of what you sent already, to a lawyer and have an hour with a fresh set of eyes. She will tell you whether you are presenting yourselves properly to USCIS and give you real advice about your own personal situation.  If this is valuable to you, do it right."

2105169,"While New Jersey has a national reputation for having excellent special education offerings, simply moving to New Jersey does not guarantee that your child will receive an appropriate education.  You son's IEP will follow him from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and your new New Jersey school will be obligated to honor it.  Whether your new school would be open to additional testing and, thus, additional services will very much depend on how your child is performing under his current IEP, whatever new medical/other information you have gathered since his IEP was adopted,  and how willing the school district is to work with you.  It is impossible to predict a school district's response.  I've worked with some school districts who really worked with parents and were open to additional assessments even though the current IEP's was less than 3 years old, and I've worked with parents where their school district fought them every step of the way.   Regardless of what state you live in, if you believe that your school district is not providing appropriate education and/or related services, you have the right to initiate ""due process.""  This means initiating a complaint and getting a hearing though the state's administrative law process (i.e., before an administrative law judge in New Jersey or before a Department of Education Hearing Officer in Pennsylvania).  While ""due process"" means lots of different things depending on what area of law you are discussing, it is well defined in the special education world and refers to the complaint/hearing process.      Unfortunately, without having any records or more specific information, it is impossible to give you any legal opinion on your matter."
1654768,"Generally speaking, you cannot just write a letter to your judicial officer.  If you desire spousal support, then you need to file a Request for Order regarding same.  And yes, the FL-157 would be a great vehicle for getting your position across, as that form goes through the factors for consideration.  You can complete a FL-157 and write a declaration as well.  Perhaps  you can go to your court's self-help center (if you have one) or pay for a consultation with a family law attorney so that can make certain that all of your paperwork is complete and proper."
1799124,"If I follow you correctly, you are inquiring about a petition for rehearing that was filed this month after the decision in 12-930, now titled LORI SCIALABBA, ACTING DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, ET AL., PETITIONERS, v. ROSALINA CUELLAR DE OSORIO ET AL.   The case was argued December 10, 2014 and decided on June 9, 2014. the Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  There is no set date for a Petition for Rehearing to be decided, particularly with the Court currently in summer recess.  If you are directly involved in this case, your questions should be submitted to your counsel.  If you are only following the case, while every petition for rehearing is reviewed on its own merits, generally speaking it is rare for one to be granted."

But if you can't afford your lawyer anymore, you can send a letter to the State's Attorney saying you've completed the conditions of the stet and asking for them to nolle pros it.

1810157,If I understand you the ex husband is a disqualified beneficiary due to the divorce and you are the second one named. You should not have to hire an attorney. Either you notify the entity holding the money or they will notify you to give you the proceeds. Even if you were to sign off not to receive the proceeds the ex would not. The proceeds would go to the deceased estate for distribution. The only way the ex could receive the money if they are otherwise disqualified is for you to receive the distribution and then give it to the ex. That is your choice not a matter of law.
1795179,"More or less the police need to do a welfare check on her (if they can find her) and so long as she is not in need of immediate medical attention, homeless, or starving then they generally will let a 17 year old be. If you want to start the meter on expensive lawyer time you are not without your options to lawfully get her back; though you might want to take a step back and think about what that might do to the already strained parent-child relationship.  Clearly there is some issue with the parent-child relationship if she would rather spend time with a drug addict than her mother; but if she is holding down her own job and performing well there, things are not as bad as they could be. The best option for you both might be to sit down with someone you both can trust, and start airing out the grievances. If you are a religious family then many of the spiritual leaders of congregations will offer a free service to sit down and talk with you both; if you both respect the leader then it really streamlines figuring out what the problem(s) are and then determining how they best can be solved. If you are not a religious family then there are many qualified counselors available in private practice - to convince her to go to one make it more about improving YOUR relationship with her, rather than making it look like she is the evil child that needs help. It's all about how you present these things, and it often needs to come with a lot of humility when you are dealing with teenagers.   As a parent I would consider all non-legal options first (such as therapy or ""mediation"" with a spiritual leader) before I go the nuclear route involving lawyers which could further fracture the relationship. Best of luck however you choose to handle your business though"
1799299,"I am sorry for your mother's injury. You need to know that slip and fall / trip and fall accidents are often very difficult personal injury claims to pursue. In a slip and fall / trip and fall claim, both the property owner and the injured victim can be held to varying degrees of responsibility, we often call this concept ""comparative negligence.""   As you have learned slip and fall accidents can cause serious / significant personal injury. it is estimated that slips, trips and falls kill more than 16,000 Americans each year. Under California law and generally in most states to be legally accountable for a personal injury a victim has suffered, such as your mother, the owner of the premises (or the entity in possession) or their employee or agent must have either caused the dangerous condition, which appears to be the case here.    Yyou should contact a personal injury attorney familiar with handling slip and fall / trip and fall cases. Most personal injury attorneys, including our firm, offer a free consultation. You should avail yourself of this very valuable and educational service  Don't delay in making a contact."
1791191,"We need to know if the title was held in Joint Tenancy.  If so, you survived the other party, and all you have to do is file an Affidavit of Death of Joint Tenant, and record it at the county recorder's office with a copy of the death certificate.  You would then own the property 100%.  However, if it is held as Tenants in Common, or if there is no reference as to how the property is held, then your father's 50% interest stays with his probate estate.  So, it will go either by the terms of a Will or Trust, or if none, to his legal heirs through probate."
1819095,"Assuming that the entire case was otherwise correctly filed, with all the necessary evidence submitted, especially the Tax return(s) for the I-864, and no Request for Further Evidence is issued, which will have the effect of ""placing a hold"" and otherwise freezing the progress of the entire case, then EAD will be issued within no later than 2 months after receipt for the case at the NVC. This is based on my office's experience during the last 12 months or so. Otherwise CIS has up to 3 months to issue EAD."
1829023,"There may be a cause of action against your ex-daughter-in-law, but whether you could recover from her monetarily is always a crapshoot.  Generally, lawsuits against individuals are impossible to collect on, as people tend to duck and evade, go bankrupt, or be ""judgmentproof.""  Either way, depending upon what you allege, you might have as little as one year from the date of the incident or far more.  For example, an allegation of either intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress would generally have to be brought within two years.  I suggest you NOT do this yourself in small claims court.  I do suggest you contact a lawyer who can walk you through what it is you can prove, why it is or is not worthwhile pursuing, and the costs/benefits."
1825650,"In order to be exempt, a firearm must be either manufactured in or before 1918 or be a ""replica"" thereof. Replica is defined as a reasonably exact reproduction of the object involved, that, when viewed, causes the person to see substantially the same object as the original. If the muzzleloader merely has an ignition system similar to that found on an antique firearm it is not a ""replica"" of a firearm manufactured in or before 1918 according to the courts.  If you possess a black-powder firearm manufactured after 1918 or one that isn't an exact replica of a firearm manufactured before 1919, then you have no legal protection in Florida. My advice - live without a firearm or risk jail time."
1798302,For tax issues you may want to speak with a tax accountant or tax attorney.
1814019,"Both must appear.  If the case is well documented and the people are prepared, the interview is often friendly and a formality.  On the other hand, if the case is poorly documented or the officer becomes suspicious, the officer will interview and question the couple separately.  All manner of questions can be asked (how many keys does it take to open your front door?  What kind of refrigerator do you have?  How many closets are in your bedroom?  What side of the bed do you sleep on? . . . The list goes on and on forever)."
1791545,"First of all, this is a call from a detective, not a lawyer. If your son is going to be subpoenaed to testify, the subpoena will come from the district attorney's office.  And even then, lawyers like to make it as easy as possible for their witnesses to testify. If you drag an unwilling witness cross-country and force him (or her) to testify, that testimony is far less likely to be persuasive than if the witness appears voluntarily.  So your son should call the detective and co-operate however he can. If the detective asks him to come to Arizona, he should just say he can't afford to make the trip. If his presence is required, the DA's office will figure out how to get him there."
1811853,"I agree with the other answers - not impossible without a specialist, just harder.  The better documented your problems are in the PCP's notes, the more likely it is that the judge will be OK with him or her being the only mental health treatment.  Keep in mind, too, that there's a hierarchy of opinions in Social Security claims, and a treating general practice doctor should rank higher than a non-treating psych under Agency rules.  If you can get your PCP to offer a detailed opinion about your mental health restrictions, that's going to be very, very helpful.  Records are good, but opinions are gold."
1815219,"There is a possibility, but class action suits are expensive. Even if it's a couple of hundred people, you're going to have a hard time finding a lawyer to take the case. Especially because the conduct you're describing is the hallmark of a defendant who doesn't have any money.  Your best bet is probably to file a small claims action and obtain a judgment."
1822346,"If I understand correctly, you have acted as a parent to this child for 10 years but never officially adopted the child.  Thus, you are only a step parent, in the legal world.  And you only have step parent rights, which are none.  You may have standing to assert an equitable adoption, and/or for third party custody rights.  The legal standards for each are different.  You would need to consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction to determine the best course of action.  You may also want to consider doing whatever you can to heal the relationship, and get the adoption done.  If you can do that, you have full legal rights the same as the biological parent."

1805175,If this is a Plan through your employer it is probably governed by Federal law known as ERISA.  Under ERISA you must appeal a denial of benefits If it is provided for under the Plan. Your Termination letter from the insurer should have spelled out your appeal rights. Under those circumstances if you did not appeal your termination of benefits within 180 days of receiving the termination letter you typically have no further recourse. Notice there are a lot of ifs in the above. The Plan must provide for an appeal and the termination letter must lay out your rights to an appeal. If this is not an ERISA case you don't have the same restrictions. Either way you should see an attorney immediately to review in detail the facts and your possible remedies.

1620905,"To answer your first question, yes they can charge you more than your security deposit even when you give proper notice of moving out. The security deposit is not a penalty for breaking the lease. It is a ""cushion"" for the landlord to have easily available money to repair any damages caused by the tenant. Sometimes the damages are more than the amount of security deposit held, and the landlord demands the remainder from the former tenant.   Even if the landlord failed to properly send the notices for the security deposit, he is still entitled to the money for the damages...provided the claim is accurate and reasonable. $1,100 to paint and clean seems excessive. Replacing blinds would not normally be a tenant expense unless you somehow damaged them to the point they needed replacing. Even so $1,100 still seems like a lot. The way to attack this is first to provide photographs of the state of the apartment when you moved in and the state of the apartment when you moved out. If you did not take photos, then your only option is to argue that the amount charged is excessive. That may or may not be the case if a lot of damage was done but many times landlords try to remodel their properties at the expense of the former tenants."
1800804,"If you return to the US after an absence of that length, you likely will be told by US immigration officials at the point of entry that they are alleging that you abandoned your permanent resident status.  They likely will take your green card, issue you a temporary document, and will likely issue you a Notice to Appear in Immigration Court.  In Immigration Court, you would need to convince the judge that you had good reasons to be away and that you never intended to abandon your permanent resident status.  Alternatively, you could apply at the US Consulate where you are residing for a Returning Resident visa.  See http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/immigrate/types/returning-residents.html  It would be best for you to consult individually with an experienced immigration attorney.  Best wishes."
1809642,"A lot will depend on the rules and policies of the USN Pension plan involved, and the impact of you being on ""in pay"" status (I am assuming that you are in fact in ""in pay"" status).  The general rule in divorce is that each party is entitled to 50% of the increase in value in the other's plan(s) that accrued during the marriage, but you just might have the right set of facts to argue for a deviation of that general rule, considering she is now on disability, and she has been living with someone else for the past 11 years.  My very kind but strong advice to you is to consult with an experienced local family law lawyer (Allison Korr is excellent) to assist you in the process.

1825500,"The general rule is that if you are an 'eligible offender,' the most that the judge can do is sentence you to 90 days.  You are an eligible offender if a) You are a NONVIOLENT offender, b) You have only a TECHNICAL violation of probation (like failure to report),  c) You have  no pending criminal charges, d) have not been convicted of a new offense, AND  e) You have not violated twice before...for any reason.  If you meet all these conditions then you are 'eligible' and the most that can be done is a 90 day sentence.    HOWEVERl...the fact that you had a 20 year sentence split 5 to serve makes me wonder if you are a 'violent offender.'  The list of violent offenses is lengthy, and even if it doesn't fit into that list, if the judge decides that your offense involved the infliction of physical harm to another, it could be considered a violent offense."

2207288,"I have a case like this right now.  Bankruptcy attorneys are not tax attorneys and sometimes bankruptcy attorneys do not do their due diligence in checking to see if a tax liability is dischargable.  Did you file tax returns for '06 and '07 or did the IRS file substitute returns on your behalf.  If so, those tax debts may not be dischargable.  I believe, the rule is under section 523 of the BK code.  Contact a tax attorney today. One will be able to pull transcripts to make a determination of whether the BK attorneys or the IRS made a mistake.  If the BK attorneys made a mistake, you may have a claim for malpractice.  Most clients want to avoid filing a malpractice suit and just want to work with a tax attorney to properly resolve the issue.  That can include putting you into currently not collectible status until the statute of limitations on collections runs or settling the matter with an offer in compromise or installment agreement.  I have clients all over the state that I work with remotely.  Best of luck."

I agree you should immediately consult and retain counsel. If his wife is unwilling to provide you a copy of the trust, you should consider opening a probate estate. Prior to that time, you will want to investigate title to all real property. Title to property may indicate the existence of a trust. Hopefully, counsel can get the wife to cooperate so that your rights under any declaration of trust can be determined and enforced.

1817472,"Your problem started with the addendum to the contract, which should have been reviewed by your attorney before you signed it.  Typically, in order to protect a seller, I include a monetary cap or limit on repairs so that if they cost more than anyone anticipated, the seller can either elect to pay for them or back out of the deal. In this case, if you had put a monetary cap of say $500.00 on the repairs you'd be willing to do, you could have easily gotten out of the contract or the buyer could have agreed to pay the remaining $700.00.  Depending on the wording of the contract and the addendum, you may well be stuck with performing this contract, which the buyers could force you to do if they elect to seek ""specific performance"" of the contract through a court proceeding.  In the alternative, they could sue you for damages (if they didn't want the house), the basic measure of which is the difference between the value of the house and the contract price.  As noted, the buyers could have other additional damages, and the realtors may have damages too if you back out.  I think you should try to sweeten your offer to the buyers by offering the furniture plus some cash to apply toward the repair.  Finally, you cannot do much litigating for $1,200.00 so a settlement would be the best route for you. If you get the case settled, make sure you get a signed release of all claims from the buyer.  Consult with you attorney about any settlement and release."

1824267,"As with many legal questions, the answer is ""possibly"" or ""it depends.""  State law will almost certainly provide for the possible involuntary discharge of a resident from a long term care facility.  You will want to consult with a California attorney who is experienced in local nursing home and long term care facility practice in order to get a definitive answer to your question.    The attorney will likely want to know the type of facility in question.  Is it a nursing home?  Is it an assisted living facility?  Is it characterized in another fashion?  After determining the type of facility involved, the attorney will know which state statute applies to potential discharge of a resident from the facility.  My guess is that California has very specific laws governing such matters.  In my jurisdiction, a resident could be involuntarily discharged from a nursing home for medical reasons or if the resident presents a danger to himself or others.  You have stated that this particular resident does not suffer from dementia.  That suggests his behavior is not a consequence of a medical condition.  Of course, other medical conditions could be causing this type of behavior.  While disruptive, the information you provide does not suggest that this person is dangerous.   If you have not discussed this resident's disruptive behavior with facility administration, you should do so.  Perhaps your mother's room can be moved within the facility.    Beyond that, I urge you to consult with an experienced lawyer in your jurisdiction about this matter.  It may be ""possible"" for the facility to discharge the resident, but it will ""depend"" on the resident's behavior, the nature of the facility and the applicable state laws pertaining to this situation.  The attorney will also be able to provide you with counsel regarding the rights of your mom and other facility residents pursuant to applicable state statutes.  Good luck."

If I am understanding your question correctly, the answer is yes but that does not happen very often.  In almost all cases the judge will want to meet with and take testimony from the claimant and, frankly, it is in your best interest to do so.

253669,"The answer my colleague has  given is absolutely correct.  Many people are confused as to what service is and when the time to answer actually starts so it may be helpful for me to take a moment to explain.          Anytime a lawsuit is filed, whether it be a Petition of Dissolution (divorce) or any other lawsuit, both the United States constitution and the California constitution (as do all other states) require that the person who is being sued or divorced actually receives a copy of the action in order to have adequate notice of what is being filed against them, and to have the opportunity to tell their side to the court.  The law requires that the notice include a summons and copies of every one of the documents that have been filed with the court.           With a few exceptions, these documents must be personally given to the person sued in person by an adult, but not by the person who is suing them.  In other words, in a divorce, it cannot be the spouse who has filed the petition who gives the copy to the person receiving the copy.            If you are out of the country, it is possible, but unlikely that you will be served until you get back into the country.  The time you have to respond (file your response in court) is 30 days in California and that time does not start until you have been served.  Hopefully this additional information was helpful to you."
1819888,"I think it is wise to visit with an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment cases and discuss these matters in detail and get legal advice as what would be your best course of action. An attorney can give you an opinion as to whether you have a viable claim, and what procedural steps you should take.  Many attorneys handle these cases on a contingency percentage fee, taking a percentage of the recovery.  There are no hourly fees and most attorneys do not charge anything for an initial appointment to discuss your case.  I would suggest that you begin your search for an attorney on this Avvo website.

1810961,"To add to some of the other responses, at the hearing you might want to ask your attorney, on the record (in front of the judge) to agree not to assert a lien or to agree to formally waive rights to assert a lien on your case, this will make things less complicated if you recover anything later as you wont owe anything to  your former attorney.  An attorney that wants to get off your case, might voluntarily waive this right if asked nicely at the hearing and/or if asked to do so in exchange for you being less dramatic at the hearing for the motion to withdraw.  Also at the hearing, you should also ask the judge to allow you additional time on any pending issues  (to respond to motions, appear at any up coming hearings, appear for trial, etc.), continuing these dates and deadlines will allow you some time to find a new lawyer.  Finally, make sure you get your file from the lawyer that is asking to be relieved and make sure you know the contact information of the attorney on the other side of your case and confirm that attorney has your contact information.

1812481,"Anyone facing a probation revocation and new felony case truly needs to be working with retained or appointed counsel, and should direct questions and concerns about sentencing, possible defenses, and strategies to the attorney handling the cases.  General information in a public forum is not a substitute for advice from a lawyer on a specific case, and there are many sentencing possibilities that can only be fully understood after reviewing both cases, and all other facts.  As a general matter, a person on probation can face imposition of the entire sentence for the violation, for example two (2) years in the question here.  As a general matter, aggravated robbery is a serious felony in Tennessee, carrying 8-12 years for range I offenders, or a likely sentence of 3-6 years if convicted of facilitation or attempt as a Range I offender.  A court has the discretion to order a new term to be served consecutively to a probation violation term.  These are very serious matters, and Tennessee sentencing law can be complicated, so a person in this situation could be facing significantly more or less incarceration depending on the specific case and charges.  Anyone facing criminal charges should rely on advice of his or her attorney, rather than general public information from lawyers who don't know know anything about the specific case."

1791095,"I strongly recommend against letting the summons and complaint go unanswered even if you move out before the deadline. Once you are out of the property -- completely out -- the court no longer has jurisdiction to entertain the case as an unlawful detainer (eviction) case, but does the landlord know that?  Does the court know it?  If you default, maybe the landlord will go ahead and file the summons and complaint anyway, hoping to get a money judgment against you. Maybe he's not supposed to, but defaulting on the summons is more your problem than his. There is precedent for converting an eviction into a regular lawsuit when possession of the property is no longer an issue, and maybe the landlord will try to convert this into an ordinary collection case. The court would be in error to let this happen if the only summons is a special hurry-up eviction summons, but if you default, you are inviting the error. When the landlord files, even if he's not supposed to, you will have the burden to make it right, and even if you win you will have ""eviction"" on your tenant screenings and credit reports in the future. If you are determined to handle this without a lawyer, answer the complaint by exactly following the directions in the summons and make it clear that you are not in possession of the premises and there are no grounds for the court's unlawful detainer jurisdiction. If the landlord tries to file anyway, after receiving your answer, you have a much better position for financial recovery for wrongful filing."
1866189,"I think I would like to know a little more about the structure terms before commenting.  This is hardly a simple scenario as it is presented.  Usually, all liens are required to be accounted for, settled and/or to have hold harmless agreements executed for them before funds issue.  Further, liens are taken care of from up front money, normally, and not over time as lien holders rarely, if ever, will accept terms.    My first question, though, is why is he your agent for receiving structured payments?  They normally do not go through IOLTA accounts (IOLA in New York, anyway), but go directly to the owner of the structure (the client).    There are tax implications for everything, and one important aspect of setting up a proper structure is avoiding something called ""constructive receipt,"" which triggers a taxable event.  This can occur when a structure is not funded directly by the defendant's insurance carrier (or, alternatively, through a SIR), but is actually delivered to an attorney f/b/o client Doe, who then funds an annuity contract.  This can have very negative tax consequences.    There are some open questions here.  You should gather some facts, such as all of the documentation you signed to close the case including general releases, waivers, hold harmless agreements, funding agreements and from before settling, lien assignments.  Liens from other states are valid liens (most especially if you acknowledged them), they are just more difficult for the lien holders to enforce.  There really isn't enough information here to provide a simple answer except to say that, normally, it would be exceptionally unusual for you to have an agent receiving your structured settlement payments.  It would be improper under normal circumstances for such an agent to withhold your payment unless the law imposed a higher duty upon him or her as one exercising his or her fiduciary duty as an officer of the court.  There may be an ethical dilemma raised as to duty to the client versus third party creditors, but the law might mitigate in favor of an innocent third party.  That, however, would be a question for the court to resolve upon a motion for disposition of funds.  There are many questions raised by this seemingly simple query.  With a few more facts, perhaps we might be able to shed some light on the question."

Again, that's not necessary (or even expected) but anything to make you feel better and give you more confidence...  Why do you think your application to extend your visa will be rejected?

I would ask them (in writing) to pay for a rental until you can get your car back AND to pay all related fees for getting the car back.

1822863,"The light is probably not anything you can act on, if it was not there when you moved in then it would be hard to say it needs to be put in after you moved in. If there is some sort of health or safety hazard that requires the light then maybe that is a route to look into more.  More information is needed for the dryer hook up, what is the current condition and what are you proposing is needed to make it safe.   Check your lease to make sure you are not liable for pest control. Have the roaches been there since you moved in? Call you local code compliance or code enforcement to make the reports of the safety and health items and see if they will issue a notice.  As Mr. von Dohlan stated, you need to send the repair request via certified mail in order to even start the discussion of termination or other actions. I have a guide to how to properly send the notice to the landlord which you can find at: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/how-to-properly-main-important-letters-lease-notices-for-texas-"
1826208,"The victim in a case is a ""witness"" for the State. Whether or not the State's Attorney's Office decides to go forward and prosecute is in the sole discretion of the office. If it has not already been dismissed, the only action I can recommend is to call and try to explain your opinion and views to the Division Chief or the current ASA's supervisor. It is still unlikely that the decision to dismiss would change."

1816817,"since you were convicted, you will not be able to obtain a certificate of eligibility from the florida department of law enforcement and you do not qualify for a record sealing. i am not aware of any federal rule to the contrary, but suggest you contact a miami based federal criminal defense attorney to confirm this information."
1799364,"Your husband will likely be on the hook, whereas you will not. Unless there is an issue of negligent entrustment, you as a non-owner and non-driver will not be held liable.   However, this is based on my understand of TN law only, and I would strongly suggest you (and your husband) contacting a local attorney where the accident occurred.   The common law theory of negligent entrustment is that one who entrusts his vehicle to another whom he knows to be inexperienced, careless, or reckless, or given to excessive use of intoxicating liquor while driving, is liable for the natural and probable consequences of the entrustment. ‰Ûâ  See: Owensboro Undertaking & Livery Ass'n v.

1820419,"You should really consult with an attorney who does tax certiorari work first; considering the amount of real property tax at stake, it should be worth the investment.  Subject to what your tax certiorari attorney will tell you, I would consider filing a FOIL request (Freedom of Information Law) first to get a copy of the files they have on you.  That should contain references to the information they used to make the assessment.  Getting an idea of where they're coming from should make it easier to successfully attack the assessment rather than simply filing a tax certiorari grievance first and throwing everything you can think of at it."
1796647,"Unless you have an express agreement to the contrary, you are an at will employee, meaning you can be terminated at any time for any reason.  Giving notice of your resignation is good enough to terminate you on the spot.  It does not matter if you give notice verbally or in writing.  Giving notice is generally a good idea if you ever want to rely on a positive reference from this employer or a ""for rehire"" designation on your termination paperwork.  Good luck to you."

1820486,"If the original charge resulted in a conviction, then it cannot be expunged.   Only probation before judgment,  a stet,  acquittal,  or nolle prossequi can be expunged.   The first two require that you wait three years.   In addition,  you cannot have any pending charges or subsequent convictions at the time you file for expungement.   So,  if the new theft charge occurred before you filed for expungement and was still pending or resulted in a conviction,  then your Petition will be denied.   I recommend that you contact an attorney to discuss the chronology.   If the Petition was filed before the new charge,  you have an argument that you are still eligible."
1819994,Discuss this issue with your lawyer.  You didn't say if there are any assets.  Fees can also be put on credit cards.  If you really earn what you say it is unlikely you will pay her fees prospectively but you might have to at the end.
1799513,"It depends.  IF, and that's a huge IF, it was done in total bad faith to harass him and done illegally, knowing he was truly already punished, then you may have standing as a civilian.  He may not be able to sue (under the Ferres Doctrine - Google it), but his retirement is also YOUR entitlement too.  It would be a very unique situation, but perhaps.   He certainly cannot be punished, and presumably he has been released from location A and signed in to location B.  Now, understand, that there are many things that require total separation from military (orders, clearing post, AND final accounting of pay).   Until he has all of these, he's still in the military.  But if he signed into his final location, perhaps the prior unit has no jurisdiction over him.  Depends on whether he was on leave too...  quite complicated.  He would be under HRC or whoever published his orders.  So the first unit may not have control over him.    This is quite complicated, as you can see.   He needs to get a great lawyer, immediately, to stop this."
1808602,There are other places beside avvo to research lawyers and law firms. Two online resources to start with are Findlaw.com and lawyers.com. There is also the well respected Martindale Hubbell Legal Directory issued annually in multiple volumes and available at most libraries. You can also ask the lawyer you are considering for personal references or look at his or her profile on LinkedIn.
1789049,"No one else has raised this so I will. It sounds like your daughter, the parent of the 16 month old child, is willing to allow you to take care of the child.  Illinois law permits your daughter to appoint you as the Short-Term Guardians {see Illinois Compiled Statutes Chapter 755, Section 5/11-5.4 and for example the Duties of Short-Term Guardian of a Minor in 755 ILCS 5/11-13.2} of the child. If your daughter signs a document under this statute, you can function as the guardian of the child for up to a year. After that, your daughter could do the same thing for another year.  In order for your daughter to give you such authority for more than a year, a court guardianship proceeding would be necessary."
1793779,"Unfortunately the situation describes happens more than you think.  You will need to probably modify your current court order so that it gives you permission to take the child outside of the US without Dad's permission.  Be advised that a cruise line or airplane might not let the child board even with a court order.  Many still require the non-traveling parent to sign a notarized form that states the trip is ok.  I know this from personal experience.  I agree with the other attorneys - you need to talk to a Houston family law attorney about your situation.  If you were planning a trip this summer, you might not be able to get it done since many Harris County courts have dead weeks in the summer."
1790758,"If I were in your shoes, I would wait to be served.  Although I have not had a client in Fulton have this happen to them, I have had clients in Cobb and DeKalb be detained at the courthouse while they send for the sheriff to ""serve"" you or be ""forced"" or ""tricked"" into acknowledge service (same as begin served) to get a copy.  So you are right to be concerned about getting a copy."
1826028,"No, he won't automatically get ""custody or visitation"". He would have to file a separate legal action in order to obtain that. All CSE establishes is paternity and child support.

1816938,"My honest advise is that if you wish to deviate from the guidelines, you should do an actual stipulation of settlement.  You would otherwise need to specify the factors upon which you've relied upon to deviate from the guildelines & the worksheet really doesn't allow you to space to specify same (i.e., it's not a matter of just ""checking off"" the factors listed on the worksheet).  You can then use the stipulation to correct the errors, as you'd otherwise need thw worksheet to contain your notarized signatures & you don't want to sign off on a submission to the court which contains known errors.  Schedule a consult with a NYC Divorce attorney for more info."
1820547,"A good defense would be lack of notice, meaning there was no signage indicating the restriction or that the pavement color was not red or otherwise painted to give you warning not to park where you did."
1809209,"I don't believe its appropriate for a lawyer to sign the client's name to a document and then notarize it.  That creates two problems. The first is notarizing a document not signed in your presence is generally considered gross negligence or fraud; and second, a lawyer who signs a client's signature without authority has acted in excess of his or her authority.  I can see potential bar disciplinary proceedings, sanctions or contempt from a judge, and the potential for some personal liability as well as criminal liability.  Click on ""Find a Lawyer"" and locate an attorney who handles Probate/Guardianship matters to see if you can undo this mess for you."
1689142,"I agree you should ask his lawyer, but it sounds like they are wanting clarification for if the Judge sentenced appropriately hope that's helpful"
1825588,"Based on these facts, what opposing counsel did was wrong.  He should have filed a motion with the court to stop the subpoena from going forward.  You will have to file a motion to get a court order.  If you are in Superior Court, you will have to comply with Superior Court Rule 9C which requires you to have a conference with opposing counsel about the dispute and file an affidavit with your motion that you have complied with the rule.  You should call opposing counsel anyway to find out what his objection is to the subpoena and maybe you can come to some agreement about what the third party has to produce."
1797392,"Speaking as a former magistrate: Yes. All that is needed is that the Magistrate finds probable cause, which the US Supreme Court has actually held to be less than 50%!  (Seriously, legal ""probable cause"" is less than mathematical probable cause.) Still, the Magistrate may have incomplete information, but so long as the magistrate believes the person and finds probable cause (which is easy), a warrant can be issued.  Still, sometimes a good defense attorney can show that the Magistrate should not have issued the warrant in the first place, which can be very helpful sometimes. For this, you will want to hire a local defense attorney with experience and knowledge in this field.  Also, If someone knowingly lied to a Magistrate to get a criminal summons issued, then that is a crime, and can even lead to a civil lawsuit for defamation, malicious prosecution, and other crimes. You should consult with an attorney on that as well."
1812925,"If he had already filed for divorce in MA, there is an automatic stay on the assets.  This means neither party can change the other's financial position through liquidation, transfer, or sale of any major asset.  Your husband may be entitled to half of the retirement through a QDRO as are you his.  I suggest, due to your concerns, that you hire an attorney who can perform discovery over the last x years to develop a financial picture of the marriage and parties."

1825647,"I agree that you should meet with an elder law attorney.  You would create the trust first, then fund it with whatever assets you want to put in it.  But, there are many different trusts that can be created, such as a revocable trust, or irrevocable trust.  There are potential tax issues, and planning for protection of the assets in case you need to go on Medi-Cal or acquire Veterans Benefits.

The court needs to determine if the modification is in the child's best interest. Please refer to Florida Statute 61.13.

If you have further questions I would suggest you contact a local attorney.  Also remember to get any verbal agreements with your EX in writing in the future."
1815543,"The at-fault driver's insurance company will ultimately be responsible for the towing charges. If they don't make a quick determination of fault, though, you may need to pay to get the truck out of the pound to avoid racking up excessive storage fees."
1814083,"Absolutely not! Modification or not....he has no authority to tell his employer to disregard order.  Employer has duty to withhold and must continue to garnish his wages until such time as a new order is provided to employer. From my experience working on behalf of clients with DCSS, the information provided by your case worker is correct.  It is good that your case was escalated to a supervisor. DCSS  has so many cases and you are fortunate that your case worker took the time to do this for you.   Best of luck!"

1824333,"No, but you need to make sure you go to court. If you do not go a warrant will be issued for your arrest and your driver's license suspended. Make sure you go to court. They will probably work with you. Also, ask the prosecutor to reduce your speed to 69 in a 55 to keep the charge off of your driving history."
1804568,It sounds like he was indicted on a case (indictment returned) but that he has not be served with the indictment.
1820023,"I'd say gray area, probably not a violation. Keep in mind the big picture of what a credit report is. A credit report reports the status of ""debts"" (or accounts) to determine the debtor's credit worthiness. It is not about what the creditors/collector is doing or not doing. With any FCRA issue, the core question is whether the entry is inaccurate such that is misrepresents your credit worthiness. On a mortgage debt that ""did initiate"" a foreclosure, I don't know that you get a FCRA violation when a new entity inherits the mortgage claim and reports what is otherwise true about ""that claim,"" that a foreclosure was initiated.   Now, if you are going to file for other FCRA violations anyway, might as well raise the issue."

1813190,"Based on your statement that you were purportedly served some 13 years ago, and that the default judgment was based on proof of such service, it is likely too late to move to vacate the default judgment. Answer the subpoena by stating the facts. In any case, SSI income is not available to judgment-creditors. Consult with an experienced litigator who has bankruptcy experience and understands exempt property. You may also be qualified to receive pro bono legal assistance. Contact legal services at the link below to see if you are entitled to assigned counsel without cost to you. Good luck."
1996172,"Since the police were never called, there is little chance you will be facing criminal charges. I agree with my colleagues that you should ignore the civil demand letters...even if they keep coming. There is little chance they will pursue a small claims lawsuit for such a small amount. It's simply not worth their time. Sounds like you may have caught a break on this incident. Hopefully you have learned a lesson and will change your behavior. You may not be so lucky next time. Merry Christmas!"
1801763,"You should put all the tenants on written leases using a form you are comfortable with because it will include the additional rules (like late fees) that you are accustomed to and can give you extra rights.  However, you are not required to do this.  It appears that your property is in Seattle, which means the tenants have some additional rights that non-Seattle tenants do not have.  The best practice would be to give a 60 day notice of change in terms (instead of the usual 30 days) that puts them on a written month-to-month lease and increases the rent to market rate.  Note there are also numerous attachments (including a summary of landlord-tenant laws) that must be included in the notice/lease.  This protects you and is easier legally and administratively than having two deadlines that give you only a minor increase in rental income."
1801769,"Until you are properly served, you have no duty to respond to her request for a domestic violence restraining order. That being said, I would check on the following items:  I would suggest that you check the court website to see if the case has been taken off calendar or if the case has been heard. Generally court websites will indicate whether orders have been granted or not.  If you are unable to determine this online I would suggest that you speak with the court clerk to determine if there are any future hearing dates. I would also suggest that you review the DV-110 to see if any of the orders have been granted pending hearing. I would also suggest you to determine whether a hearing has occurred and whether the orders have been reissued. If they have been reissued there may be a future hearing date. I caution client's against responding until they have been properly served."
2520780,"The correct answer to your question is YES. If your employment began in New Jersey, New Jersey will assert jurisdiction over your workers compensation case, so long as your employment was not interrupted for very long. The place of the making of the original contract of employment controls jurisdiction. You can establish a case in New Jersey by filing a claim petition in New Jersey. Remember that for certain types of cases, typically back, neck, head, and shoulder claims, you have the right to greater compensation in New Jersey than in New York, under many circumstances. Pick a CERTIFIED workers compensation attorney in New Jersey."
1795270,"I agree with my colleague, anyone can file a suit, which will win or lose based on the merits of the litigation. If a civil action interferes with a criminal investigation, on Motion it is typically stayed until the criminal case is resolved. I suggest you discuss this with a civil litigation lawyer to determine the viability of the civil action before you make any decisions about proceeding."
1819142,"Since this seems to be an issue that will be ongoing for several years, you want to make sure that the agreement y'all make is going to do what you expect it to do in the future. Once the decree is signed, you are likely not going to be able to undo it ever. You really need to have a lawyer draft and explain the decree to you, and also tell you what problems you might have in the future, and what parts of this arrangement may not be enforceable in the future."
1819654,"There is no inheritance/gift tax unless your father's estate (plus lifetime gifts) was over $5.3 million, and as my colleague states, it is deducted from that estate before distribution, but you should talk to a CPA, about this, as well as preparing the final tax return for your father, as well as how to account for your 25% ownership in terms of value (called basis in CAP speak). Tax questions are more suited for a CPA or a tax attorney."
1801354,"Do NOT threaten what you cannot do.  Do not LIE to the other side's attorney.  That will blow up in your face.  You do not state what your evidence of fraud is, nor should you openly in this forum.  What you should do is speak with a family law attorney.  You should do that for several reasons.  First and foremost, you need to develop the information and get evidence to support your contentions.  Seek a lawyer."
1794795,"What I am guessing occurred here is that the GAL had a judgment against your former husband for unpaid fees. The GAL then recorded a memorandum of judgment. This would lien any real estate owned by your former husband in the county in which it was recorded. If the real estate to which you refer is still owned by your former husband, then this lien attached to that real estate."
1810214,"Of course, in mediation, you are going to offer her the percentage of her purchase.  It is possible the Court could award her fifty percent.  However, it is doubtful she would be awarded that much considering the length of the marriage.  Just be sure to have any and all receipts as well as any and all checks that have cleared.  The more evidence you have, the better off you are.  Good luck."
1817745,"You are taking the wrong path.  Apply for deferred action for childhood arrivals. This will give you an opportunity to get a work permit, driver license and also to apply for advance parole.  Applying for advance parole after you receive DACA will give you a legal entry to the US then you can pursue a marriage at any point in the future."

1792670,"Well as long as the home is the Principal Office there is no harm in doing that. If you were trying to obscure the location of the Principal Office that might raise some question. But frankly, I've never seen this detail arise as part of the analytics that give rise to personal liability for the owner/manager of an LLC. No being a registered agent has nothing to do with personal liability issues. If it did you would never see lawyers doing this for their clients, but in reality they do it all the time."

If you find anything that raises the question that you may be financially liable, take it to an employment attorney and have it reviewed. Most reputable employers will give you time to read and review all forms that you are being asked to sign. Don't provide financial information such as credit card or account information to your employer.  Best of luck!"
1828144,"The Expunction statute doesn't clearly address federal databases, but to the extent that NCIC is drawing information from state sources the Expunction should be effective there. My experience has been that expunged cases don't show up in NCIC checks, but that is not a certainty."
1791338,"It seams that you qualified for State Medicaid benefits under exceptions to the rules of the federal means-tested public benefits.   You should report your green card as lost and replace it with a new card.

If USCIS needs additional documents, they will request it.  Your wife, as your I-864 sponsor, is responsible to financially support you during your permanent residency.  But, the sponsor's use of means-testes benefits does not disqualify  her from being the sponsor. It simply means those benefits  are not counted toward income."
1824839,"Yes he can.  And he is not going to ask for a hearing because nothing will happen until it is heard--he does not want anything to happen, so he will not do anything.  You will need to get the hearing scheduled.  It should be obvious, but you are probably not going to get very far without a lawyer when the other side has one.  If law were a DIY project, there would not be any lawyers."

1794896,"If the property is in your name alone (that is the name shown on the deed), your wife does not have any ownership interest in your property.  The only way you can get her name off of the mortgage is if you refinance or if the mortgage lender agrees to release her from liability (this is not likely to happen).  Having her name on the mortgage, while it may make her life more difficult, should not cause you any problems.  If you are unsure of your rights and responsibilities as a homeowner and mortgagor, you should consult an experienced real estate lawyer in your area."
252719,"According to R.N.C., Inc. v. Tsegeletos, 231 Cal.App.3d 967, 972-73, 283 Cal.Rptr. 48 (1991), on an account stated complaint, the four-year statute of limitations period begins when credit is no longer extended on the account.  You would review your old account statements to find this date.  The lawsuit must be filed with the clerk of the court within four years of that date.  If you prove that the case as filed after statute of limitations period, you may also be able to get the debt collector to pay your actual damages, costs, and attorney's fees.  Also, there are many things that a debt collector must prove in court to win, even if they filed the lawsuit within the statute of limitations.  However, if the defendant or his/her attorney fails to properly object to inadmissible evidence and fails to present evidence showing the defects with the case, the court is likely to enter a judgment against you. I have been handling such cases for individual consumers since 1997.  Please contact me through my Avvo profile for a consultation."
1826334,"I agree with my colleagues; the statute of limitations is a defense if they sue you.  The statute of limitations in Hawaii is 6 years from the date of the last acknowledgement of the debt.   The inability to pay, alone, is not a defense.

Check the Federal Trade Commission web site for consumer and debt collection information."

1811196,"Hi: I agree with the other attorneys, but I would add that if I read your question correctly, this debt was discharged in your 2004 chapter 7, such that this is also a violation of your bankruptcy discharge, punishable by the assessment of sanctions. Before you speak to an attorney, verify that the creditor was listed in your bankruptcy papers? That it was a dischargeable debt that you did not reaffirm, and that you received your bankruptcy discharge; and if you can verify all this, tell this to the attorney and show the attorney the relevant paperwork. Good luck!  The information contained in this posting is for general information purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

If you need to probate the will in New Jersey it is quite simple when compared to other states. If you cannot resolve the problem very easily with the insurance company you can probate the will with the surrogate in your county. If you're in Burlington county you should contact the surrogate's office and they will certainly help you get everything you need to do accomplished.

1828736,"Well, the purpose of a debtor's exam is to see if there are any non-exempt assets to pursue against your judgment debtor.  As you mention, you already have judgment...so you would next have to see if there was some basis to pursue an asset of the judgment debtor.  In this case, you seem to be implying that there might be a potential inheritance?  To answer your main question, no...there is no basis to pursue a possible future inheritance.  However, if there is a business, you may want to dig into that a bit deeper.  If it is a coporation, then it's likely protected from any kind of execution (unless the debtor has been commingling personal with business assets and liabilities).  However, if it is not incorporated (a dba)...then you may be able to pursue business assets.  If this judgment represents a large sum of money, you may want to consider hiring an attorney to collect.  Often they will do so on a contingency fee basis (25-40% of whatever they collect).

I suggest you contact a personal injury attorney who specializes in workers' comp to help guide you through this process."
1805071,"That is unfortunate.  Just to clarify - you are not an employee of the hospital, correct?  And your only relation to the chief resident is that you are the wife of one of his residents, right?  I am not aware of any statute that would provide a cause of action for discrimination to a non-employee, and I am pretty sure the interpretation of federal and state civil rights statutes doesn't favor such causes of action.  Perhaps you could prepare the emails for your husband using his email so they come from him rather than you....  Good luck."
1800152,"I am very sorry about the facts you present.   There are jurisdictional issues to be considered when filing.   It would seem that the divorce needs to be filed in Colorado, where he resides, so that the courts have personal jurisdiction over him for financial orders.    Colorado is a no fault state, but does allow consideration of economic fault and/or dissipation of marital assets when equitably dividing the marital estate.  This can come into play when there is a girlfriend.   Also, once you file, an Automatic Temporary Injunction goes into effect, which can be implicated if he is spending money on the girlfriend.   Best of luck to you!"

1793711,"You have done the appropriate thing by reporting the wrongdoing.  Assuming HR has adjusted your pay so that you got paid correctly, there is nothing more you can do.  It is up to the company to decide how to handle the supervisor.  In the mean time, keep a small journal where you log your hours separate from the official timecards.  If you notice it happening again, report it again.  If the employer is not paying your appropriately, you need to report that, and if that does not resolve, you will have to decide if you want to make a claim against the employer (not the supervisor) for the wages that are owed.  Good luck to you."

1815687,"The way to frame this for the judge is not that your rights are being violated, but that the PI trailing you and your child is not in YOUR CHILD'S BEST INTERESTS. What is in the ""child's best interests"" is the north star for the custody/visitation decisions of family law judges. Note that you probably can't get a restraining order against the PI, but you can request an order which restrains the mom from having a PI follow your child around (i.e. check the box on the FL-300 form for ""other"" relief and specify). In your declaration, state the fact that you stated in your question -- that your daughter knows of it and looks over her shoulder all the time (and other similar facts). Argue that that mom's actions causes your daughters' visitation experience with you to suffer and that is antithetical to a positive father/daughter relationship.

1792105,"I am sorry out of state attorneys have offered you incorrect advice here, but here is the correct answer.  They will do two things.   One, they will send you a letter of proposed suspension.  Two, they will make you restart you provisional period of 18 months with no tickets before you can convert to a full license.  As to that letter, it will offer you the option to request a hearing.  If you do, you can explain and ask them not to suspend you and you can take a lawyer to help convince the administrative law judge to give you a break.  I usually recommend that my clients do a driver improvement program also before the hearing to increase the odds of leniency"
1798593,"You do not provide information regarding physical and legal custody orders regarding your daughter. Parents often retaliate against the other parent regarding many issues relating to their child(ren).  As you know, child support is mutually exclusive from legal custody and the rights of both parents.  You should not delay in seeking legal assistance due to the fact that your daughter will be 18 soon and graduate high school.  Minor's counsel is appointed by the court if it is determined to be in the best interest of child.  In your case, father's inference with SAT preparation and locating employment appears contrary to the best interest of your daughter.  You do not provide specific facts regarding how he is interfering.  The procedure is to file a Request for Order to include a request for appointment of Minor's Counsel (CA Family Sections 3150-3153).  I also concur with colleague that your daughter could request emancipation, however, this will affect current court orders that may be in her best interest and yours."

But I digress."
1811876,"A motion to modify sentence must be filed within 90 days of the setence's imposition.  However, the  question is what happened to the original motion filed two days after trial.  Considering such a motion, let alone granting the relief requested, is within the sound discretion of the sentencing Judge.  I would first determine, from whomever filed the first, timely  motion on your behalf, what resulted from that filing.  It is possible it was denied without a hearing.  If no action was ever taken on the first motion, you might consider asking the court to reconsider the denial of your second motion on the grounds that it be amended to serve as a renewed request to have the original, timely submission, considered and ruled upon. Of course, engaging the services of a qualified attorney is the best means to sort through the actual facts and circumstances, and then arrive at the best approach to hopefully resolve the matter."

Not worth it.  The type of ""training' or ""internship"" or ""cultural exchange visa"" which you will need to apply for one of those sales jobs is a J-1 visa.  You will first need to find an employer that is wiling and able to sponsor you for a J-1.

1797679,"Attorney Elie is correct but please meet with an attorney first.  The Trustee steps into your shoes when you file.  They may liquidate what you can liquidate to pay creditors.  If you have property that is not exempt (protected) that property may be subject to liquidation for cash to pay creditors.  This is not a simple issue that you have and I would consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney before filing.  This may be a matter of timing and you don't say how much you earn or what the property is worth which would determine whether you qualify for a Chapter 7, 13 or may want to consider an individual Chapter 11.

In immigration, I think the word ""counselor"" is often forgotten and people think they only need the attorney/lawyer once all the bad stuff has happened.

1811344,"""Shouldn't we be splitting everything (income and debts) down the middle until the divorce is finalized?"" There is no such law in WA that would require spouses, divorcing or otherwise, to split anything anyway unless there is a court order.  Even when the court orders a division of assets and debts, the division is just and equitable, not ""down the middle"". Depending on the facts, a spouse may get from 0% to 100% of the assets and debts.  If there is a family law petition filed with the court, you can ask the court for temporary orders.  If you believe the husband is spending all the savings, you need to act quickly before all the savings are gone. Unless there is a court order restraining the spouses from disposing of their assets, the court may not do anything if all the assets are gone by the time the court hears the case.  You should review the specific facts with your attorney to find out your legal options."
1795528,"As stated above, you should go to the Court where the charge was pending and ask the Clerk of that Court to view the file and make copies. If the Battery was the only charge against you and it was dismissed, then no, you did not enter a plea.  If there were other charges, then it is possible you plead to the Battery in exchange for a dismissal of the other charge(s).  When looking at your file, look for a Dismissal Order and a Judgment Order.  If your charge was dismissed, there should be a Dismissal Order stating such.  Either way, the Judgment Order will have the final disposition stated clearly on it.

Unfortunately,  this process takes time and is not going to be able to be conducted in 30 days, as getting a certified copy of your record from the State Police can take between 2-6 months. You should consult with a qualified criminal defense attorney with experience dealing with juvenile expungments.

1666734,"Every situation is different.  A lot of time a plea agreement takes place but not necessarily.  It doesn't mean you have a lousy attorney.  There could be some very valid reasons why there is no agreement (i.e., the government will not provide one or their agreement isn't beneficial to you).  You should talk to your lawyer and ask him or her why that is the case."
1810585,"Given that there is apparently $60,000.00 in equity I would strongly encourage you to speak with counsel.  The questions you ask require more information to offer proper responses to.  That said, I will make some basic assumptions and indicate that if the deed is authentic, filing it shouldn't be a problem.  However, given that your mother has passed away having the deed be part of a probate will go a long ways towards preventing the problems that could arise.  Think of it from the perspective of an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  That is surely the case in this instance.  Best of luck."

There is certain opt out language  that also must be included that probably is not contained in the letter.  The opt out language states the formula of what you would have been entitled to under the Child Support Standards Act.   There will be a presumption that you are entitled to a pro-rata share of 25% of adjusted gross income.  As you noted, that figure is approximately $100 per week, not $50 per week.

(c) A person is deemed incapable of consent if he is: (1) Less than 16 years old; or (2) Mentally defective; or (3) Mentally incapacitated; or (4) Physically helpless.  Therefore a person who is ""mentally defective"" cannot, as a matter of law, consent to sexual relations. Your best course of action is to contact the Office of the District Attorney and request to speak to the 'Victim Services Officer' for more information or, in the alternative, to contact the local law enforcement agency of the location where you reside and request to speak to a criminal investigator and provide this same information, or perhaps contact the Office of the District Attorney and local law enforcement at the same time."

There are several options you may have, one of which would include filing a motion to hold the offending party in contempt (which, if successful, will typically result in the court taking action against the offending party to secure compliance in the future).

Yes, since the payment was made to you, they can sue you as well as the person that did the work.   Your family member should pay for the attorney, or cover any amounts that are owed, unless you also took some of the money.   It sounds to me like your family member did not have a contractor's license.  If that is the case, he will certainly lose, and could be required to pay back the full amount and possibly more.   If you cannot afford an attorney, you should at least consult with one.  You need to do that quickly, because you only have a limited amount of time to respond to a lawsuit or you will be in default. You would not be entitled to a public defender.  Those are only available in criminal cases. But, since contracting without a license can lead to criminal charges, if either of you end up being charged with a crime, you will then be able to get a public defender.  That is not good news for you though.  Better to hope that it just stays in the civil lawsuit.   You may also want to talk to a bankruptcy attorney."

1827045,"I agree with my colleague.  There is a common misconception that if you are on disability leave then you are untouchable.  Meaning, that if you get fired while on leave then that somehow automatically triggers discrimination.  That is simply not true.  The law says that if an employer engages in adverse employment action (such as a termination) because of your disability then that is actionable.  However, you have to prove causation.  You have to prove that you were fired specifically because you are disabled.  That's not easy to do.  You need emails, conversations, witnesses, words or conduct that point to your disability being a significant factor in why you were fired.  Employment attorneys often give free consultations specifically for the reason to use that time to dig into the facts.  It is nearly impossible to know all the important details of what went on simply from this sparse post and as such a detailed analysis from an attorney should not be expected.  You need some one-on-one with an attorney in your area.  Good luck."

You can, however, call the police and report this (whether they'll do anything is an open question, but at least you can make the report, and it will look better coming from you than it will from the nephew's mother). I don't believe this gives you an independent basis for any sort of civil claim, either.   You can also notify the child's mother of this incident. Even if the police don't investigate, your testimony (or your daughter's) could be invaluable to her."
1817327,"You were arrested and you need to specify the incident in the FORM N -400. It is a minor event but do not omit it from your application. Hopefully, you do not have any other incidents that may cause you a problem in applying for naturalization. Best of luck to you."
1824615,"I assume you have no assets - real estate, vehicles that you own, bank accounts with significant cash, ect. If this is the case, insurance is not going to waste too much time trying to squeeze blood from a turnip.  Do not sign anything or make any admissions or speak about this incident with opposing insurance without consulting with an attorney. Have you already been served with a lawsuit or is this just a threatening demand letter you've received from insurance? It's doubtful you'll be able to get a free attorney but you maybe able to find an attorney that will represent you on a limited basis, write a letter explaining you have no assets and will declare bankruptcy if any judgment is obtained against you and provide proof of the same.  The other party likely has uninsured motorist protection which is supposed to cover situations like this although this doesn't mean you're not liable. But as I said the time, expense, and hassle of bringing suit, obtaining a judgment and then trying to levy non-existing bank accounts, garnish non-existent wages, or lien non existent property will be a pointless exercise. I assume opposing party doesn't realize or believe you have no job, accounts, or assets.  Call personal injury attorneys in your area. Although these attorneys normally sue insurance companies and don't represent defendants, someone will help you hopefully for a small fee.  Don't make any rash decisions and stay on top of this.  Also get insurance -- this is exactly why you need it to avoid legal and financial headaches like this"

1821528,It seems like nobody knows what is going on and they are getting themselves into what could be a very costly mess.   It is probably a good time to talk to an employment lawyer about your situation as well as continue to try to work with HR to resolve the situation. If you were approved for FMLA then it should not be your responsibility to keep trying to sort out the attendance issue or have disciplinary action hanging over your head for it.
1815332,"There is not a need to have co-trustees, but it is not prohibited either. As a practical matter, having three is going to be more difficult than having one or two. Any trustee is bound by the laws concerning fiduciary duties so technically any combination would have to abide by the same rules and administer the estate pursuant to the terms of the trust. The Trustee will have some discretionary power however, to make several decisions, it depends on what the Trust says. Ultimately it is not your decision, or your siblings, it is your mother's. I would suggest having her sit down with her attorney who drafted the trust, or any experienced estate planning attorney to discuss the pros and cons of each type of scenario and let her decide free from the influence of her children. Good luck."
1799900,"The short answer is the directors can be sued personally, and associations generally carry general liability insurance as well as D&O, meaning Directors and Officers liability coverage, for scenarios just like this. The D&O insurance carrier should appoint counsel to provide a defense. Presumably, the offending board member, even if no longer on the board, was also named in the lawsuit and although coverage under the D&O would likely extend to that director as well even if no longer a director, the policy is likely to exclude intentional or criminal acts, which would leave that former board member in a precarious situation but should not affect coverage for the other directors that did not have knowledge of what transpired."

1797414,"It depends on any orders or hearings set by the court for your particular case.  When you filed the lawsuit, the clerk should have given you or your attorney service or mailed you a notice of OSC re Proof of Service, or something along those lines. That is the date when a hear will be held related to the status of serving each named defendant and filing a proof of service with the clerk of the court. If all proofs of service for all named defendants are filed, then the hearing should be taken off calendar, which you can verify online a few days after you have filed the last proof of service.  If a defendant is being difficult, you may need to get an extension. Easiest way to accomplish that is to file a declaration at least a week before the hearing explaining your efforts or the efforts of your process server(s), along with any related documentation, being careful not to post any account or other personal information, such as SSN, DOB, or DLN.  Then appear at the hearing and advise how much more time you need to complete service or get an order for service by publication.  The courts prefer the defendants all be served and proof of service filed promptly.  Failure to do it promptly, for some judges, may raise a flag that they need to keep a tight grip on the case, as serving the defendants is supposed to be a relatively simple procedure. Hire a professional process server who can do skip tracing, if you are having trouble serving or finding the defendants.

Having said that, infertility at your age resulting from the 'wrong' surgery done could result in a very significant award of damages.   Many factors will go into the determination of what an appropriate sum to compensate you would be.  If you have a written acknowledgement of error by the doctor, make sure you keep that document.  It's golden.  It's not often that a doctor admits to malpractice.  You need to see a med mal attorney right away.   Good luck."

Evidence is to be presented to the Judge who will make a ruling on whether it is admissible.  Evidence must also be presented properly to be admitted.  You should hire an attorney to make sure all of your evidence is properly submitted to the Court.  If you do not do it right the first time you are not likely to get a second chance to submit your evidence to the Judge.

I have been conscientious and  hardworking as a public defender and as a private criminal defense attorneys - as far as other lawyers - some are and some aren't , whether public defenders or private.   You should have time to search out and have consultation(s) with other lawyers and get more than one opinion.  Finances are often an issue for why someone stays with a public defender as DUI defense is not cheap.  I would give your public defender a chance to show you what the case looks like and your options and then if you are not satisfied and can afford to hire a private lawyer, then do so.   As long as you are not near the trial date and can afford to do so, there should not be a problem to have a lawyer substitute in if necessary.    Good Luck.

1800730,"The strategic considerations that affect the relationships between licensors and licensees are the subject of lengthy text books, academic journal articles, law review articles, and ongoing substantive debates among both legal practitioners and academics.  Most, but not all, licensors have one and only one primary objective---to maximize short term and long-term financial gain from exploitation of their inventions and other intellectual property, while at the same time minimizing risk such as the costs of being mandated to participate in litigation.  The debate about ""patent trolls"" is centered around whether it is appropriate for licensors to reap substantial financial rewards even though neither the licensors nor their licensees actually practice the patented inventions.  Where the invention covers a product that is dangerous or controversial, a licensor may prefer that licensees refrain from practicing the invention unless they provide indemnification to the licensor.  Licensees take such licenses mainly because they are value as part of their defense arsenal when patent disputes arise among competitors.   In other cases, licensors may believe that they will reap more benefits by licensing or selling their invention to a ""non practice entity"" (sometimes known as patent trolls"") who generate revenue by accusing third parties of infringing the patents in their businesses.  In many circumstances, the licensors are universities, individuals or small companies who could not afford to practice the invention, but who expect to reap  meaningful profits by alleging that third parties are using the invention without authorization.  In short, sometimes it is more profitable to litigate than to license and/or practice the invention.  Finally, many companies will pay premium royalty amounts to gobble up patent rights that they can eventually use against competitors during the course of disputes over patent infringement.   Major companies have joined alliance for the purpose of purchasing rights to hundreds or thousands of patents that otherwise could be used by ""trolls"" to demand huge amounts of damages. Many Fortune 500 companies will purchase third party patent rights purely for defensive purposes---they want to have weapons to use in case one of their competitors sues for patent infringement.  These are complex, fact intensive matters, and there is no right or wrong answer as to the right overall strategy. Licensing attorneys deal with enormously complex strategy issues on matters such as this every day and in the final analysis, the devil is always in the details."

1811784,"Based on your statement that ""there is no parenting plan"", then the court will review all the evidence to determine what is in the best interests of your twin daughters.  That they are 13 makes little difference as the children only get to decide when they are 18 (although their opinions count for more as they get older).   That you have allowed this situation to continue by ""agreement"" is evidence that you believed it was in the best interests of the children so you are working ""uphill"" to some degree.   At a minimum, you should at least consult with an attorney (who will then have more facts than are present in your question) and can give you more complete advice."

It does not take much within the five year look back period for good moral character for USCIS to deny naturalization.

1819444,"Most likely you will have to deal with this bad tenant and have a semi-bad outcome.  If they are threatening this, they will do harm no matter how much longer they stay.  Hire counsel who may find a creative way to put the court on notice of the threat (which won't do much to stop it, but might give the tenant second thoughts about committing a criminal act).  If the worse happens, file criminal charges to have the tenants arrested after the threat becomes reality (not much that will be done before that), and then file a claim with your insurance company for the damages. (Hopefully you told the insurance company that you were renting the property, or this won't be covered).  Being a landlord isn't fun and is only a business for those who are willing to assume all the risks.  If you can find a way to work out a deal with the tenant (like giving them some additional time to remain the premises if that is what they really want when they made this threat, you might consider that.  Otherwise, you have a bad tenant and will have to pick up the pieces after the worst happens."

You purchased a house with money provided by your parents for the down payment, but also through the use of your good credit to qualify for a purchase your parents couldn't qualify for.  Yes, mom and dad paid the mortgage but they enjoyed the use of the property during that time.  Several key facts are missing, such as whether and how you documented this transaction with your parents.  Arguably your parents are the 'equitable' owners of the property.  Having made all of the payments on the property, your parents will argue that they are, in fact, the true owners of the property.  There are other issues such as the Statute of Frauds, substantial performance, etc.  But I'm not so sure how sympathetic your parents will be in court when the only thing they will accomplish by staying put without making payments is to lose the house in foreclosure and trash your good credit in the process.  You absolutely need an attorney to assist you in this very unfortunate situation."

1829689,"I like your question.  I hear it often.  The insurance coverage you have at the time of an incident (accident) is the insurance carrier that will handle everything related to the incident. This is true even if you switch insurance carriers before a claim is completed.  For example, let's say you have an accident on July 31, 2014 and your insurance carrier is State Farm. And let's say you think the other driver is at fault and the other driver says you are at fault. Now let's say State Farm decides to raise your insurance rates on Jan. 1, 2015 and the July accident is not settled (the other driver still claims you are at fault and wants State Farm to pay, but State Farm says no.)  You feel you  still think you are not at fault for the accident and so you shop for new cheaper insurance. You find a cheaper policy from Farmers. You can switch insurance companies and State Farm has a legal obligation to to defend you until the July 2014 accident matter is resolved (either by settlement, trial, arbitration or whatever.)   So in the situation you describe, even though you switched insurance carriers, you should contact Progressive regarding your additional damage. If Progressive agrees the additional damage is from the accident, they will pay (whether or not they agree is a different story so you should contact your mechanic to confirm the accident is the reason had the additional damage.)  Hope this helps."

1794122,"I think the other attorneys answering this misunderstood the question.  This is not your case.  In fact, it is my case; I represented the applicant in Serrano v. General Motors.  In that case, my client was found by the Agreed Medical Examiners to be permanently, totally disabled due to fibromyalgia.  The trial judge subtracted 5% for a prior award to the left thumb, and awarded permanent disability compensation of 95% instead of 100%, a huge difference in dollars and cents.  On my petition for reconsideration, the WCAB commissioners correctly pointed out that fibromyalgia affects various regions of the body--the spine, upper extremities, lower extremities, and even the psyche and various internal systems.  Thus, the pre-existing left thumb disability of five-and-one-quarter percent did not ""overlap"" with the total disability to the other regions of the body caused by the fibromyalgia.  The section of the California Labor Code addressing apportionment to a prior award is section 4664, and it actually sets forth each of the separate regions of the body for purposes of that section.  Furthermore, pursuant to Kopping v. WCAB (2006) 7 Cal.Comp.Cas. 1229, it is defendants' burden to prove overlap, and in Serrano v. General Motors, no overlap was proven by defendants as to most of the bodily regions affected by my client's fibromyalgia.  I hope this helps you to understand the decision, and to apply it to your case."

Get a lawyer now and try to minimize or avoid detention."
1818319,"There are a few things to consider with your question because it is not as straightforward as it seems.         I suggest reading the settlement and court order again because the order may require that you continue to pay the insurance and half of the medical bills while your son is in college.  If the settlement or court order does not require you to continue to pay then you will not have to pay half of the medical bills/insurance under the settlement or court order.  However, that is not the end of the analysis because you state you intend to keep him on your policy as long as you can.  You will have to look at the insurance policy because as the policy holder you may be responsible for deductibles, co-pays, non-covered items, etc.  Also, the medical provider may have a condition of treatment that states the policy holder is responsible for non-covered items.  Lastly, if  after investigating these issues it is determined you are not responsible for these bills, you will have to decide if you want to saddle your son with this type of responsibility so soon after high school and what impact it may have on your relationship with your son.   I suggest contacting an attorney to discuss these issues, review the relevant documents, and advise the options available to accomplish your goals.

Depending on which court you're in, and your financial circumstances, you may be eligible for a public defender.  Also be aware that shoplifting is an enhanced penalty offense, meaning that the sentence for a second conviction is harsher than that for a first offense, and a third offense within a certain period of time can be charged as a felony."
1936324,"If you have an attorney, by all means make an appointment to discuss this matter with him or her.  Otherwise, if you are this far into it, I wouldn't stop now. If you complete your case, since we are in a ""conduit"" jurisdiction where your trustee is paying your regular mortgage payments in addition to the arrearage, at the conclusion of your case you should receive an ""order deeming current"" which will tell the mortgage company that your mortgage loan is completely current, and they cannot add any additional ""junk fees"" like property inspection fees or BPO's (broker price opinions) or otherwise try to claim that your loan is not current.  On the contrary if you dismiss, you are pretty much at their mercy. They can add attorney fees and whatever fees and costs that they wish. Additionally, all of your other creditors would be free to start the debt collection process again. The IRS can go back and add interest and collect penalties which will otherwise be discharged if you complete your case.  The damage has been done by the filing of the chapter 13 petition. If you dismiss, it is still there on your credit for 7 years. It doesn't go away if you dismiss. It just looks like you could not afford to keep up the payments and were not able to complete the plan.   Whereas if you complete, you'll receive your discharge and the discharged creditors will have to report a 0 balance due, and your credit should improve quickly, at least if you make future payments timely. Having good credit can save you a lot of money when you finance vehicles or homes in the future."

There are many factors that may affect the immigration process when a U.S. Citizen files a petition to sponsor a foreign national spouse. You should consult an immigration attorney to discuss this further."

1822315,"Yes, possibly.  Get a construction lawyer.  Several issues. One, do,you have standing to sue?  Meaning do you own property affected by this?  If so, ok. Second, statute of limitations. You can probably be ok there too even if after six years due to the discovery rule and its not after the statute of repose. Third, who do,you sue. Most likely the builder or contractor of the retaining wall. You may sue the engineer directly but im not sure. Yes, they can be found liable   But negligent construction no longer exists in WA. Its all about economic losses.  Translation: find a good plaintiff's construction lawyer. Stanislaw Ashbaugh maybe. I use to work there. Short Cress,an maybe. Good luck. This fraught with  issues. Get a seasoned construction lawyer. Good luck."
1899374,"The California lawyer is right that you should treat this situation with care, and I'm glad to see from your answer that you do intend to see that your sister addresses these cases.  That she is nearly 18 and has a new life mostly put into place in Colorado will help resolve the cases.  Perhaps the County/District Attorney will simply join defense counsel in recommending that your sister simply pay a fine and be released from the Court's jurisdiction if she is adjudicated of the offenses.  It is unlikely that she'll face adult prosecution for these offenses, unless she has several prior and has failed on juvenile probation, in which case the County/District Attorney might seek adult prosecution arguing that there is nothing left in the juvenile system that will work for her.  (That's unlikely, in my opinion, given the relatively ""unsevere"" nature of the charges.)  Kansas law requires the juvenile and a parent or guardian to appear at the hearings, so an attorney alone won't be able to resolve it without her attendance.  Normal procedure is for the Court to appoint a local attorney to represent the juvenile unless the family decides to hire counsel; so, it is likely that your sister already has competent counsel.  If the MJ charge is indeed ""bogus,"" your sister's attorney should consider aggressively fighting it -- having a MJ adjudication follow her around for the next few years until it can be expunged might complicate her life.  (The Court could order treatment... She could be required to disclose it on college applications, student loan applications... It might cause ineligibility for loans... Lots of things to be aware of.)  You sister and family should check into whether your sister has appointed counsel in these cases and discuss your goals with them.  If you believe appointed counsel is unwilling or unable to pursue those objectives, then consult with aggressive defense counsel in the area of the cases.  Good luck!"

Technically, no sponsorship is really required for a visitor's visa, you don't need to have family or friends here to come and see New York.  However, people do often provide sponsorship letters.  It this case, it sounds as if your parents may have inadmissibility issues due to overstay and also may have a difficult time convincing an immigration officer that they will return to their home country after visiting with their DACA approved children for 6 months.  Whether your parents have a chance at getting a B visa is impossible to say from the information provided."
1805826,"Additional information and clarifications will be needed in order to adequately analyze your situation and answer your question.  What do you mean by ""authorization of the stipulation""? ""Authorization"" by whom? Did you mean ""authorization"" by a judge? Does the stipulation state that it will be effective as of the last date on which it is signed by the parties, or it requires to be approved or authorized by a judge to be effective?  If the stipulation states that it will be effective as of the last date on which it is signed by both parties and their respective attorneys, but silent as to whether it requires the approval or signature of a judge, it appears that the parties' intent is sufficiently clear and the stipulation should not be invalidated or voided, if this is what you are asking.  In either case, if the judge signed an order on May 30 approving the stipulation which is effective as of May 10 by its very language, based on the information provided here, I do not see any grounds to invalidate or void the stipulation, especially in your situation where the parties' intent seems to be quite clear and that legal counsel were involved.   In any case, you should seek competent counsel to properly analyze your situation.  Good luck!"

1792796,"I think there is a partnership, if not a 50% membership interest in the LLC that was formed. Under Florida statutes, you would presumably have a deadlock if you can't agree and you would have to sue for dissolution of the LLC. The problem with that is it may not be worth much and any bank account may not longer contain the money you contributed. Therefore, there are likely other causes of action you will need to bring including an accounting and damages."
1826111,"Many states have enacted laws which prohibit secretly recording a person in a ""compromising"" position. You can go to the police.

1786979,You can only amend a return two years after it was filed so if you are talking about tax returns in year 2011 you can't do anything.  You can file an amended return on more recent taxes with you each filing single or one head  of household but you will owe penalties most likely depending on how it changes the tax liability.  I am not sure how you stayed on the health insurance unless it was COBRA.  You could wait until you are audited if and when that happens but the penalties will only increase if you owe taxes.

1823326,"Mr. Lefkowitz and Ms. Elder are correct. You need to have a personal consult with an attorney experienced in dealing with student loans so that a comprehensive analysis can be done. This should include a review of AES' conduct and representation for potential violations of the North Carolina and Federal debt collection statutes. An experienced attorney will also review your Federal loan status to make sure you are on the repayment program that best suits your needs, and go over the options available to you for handling your private loans. This is a complex scenario which can't be addressed in an online forum and what options you have depend upon your occupation and income, among other things.  Private student loan lenders are not required to offer the same type of repayment options that Federally guaranteed loans get, so your only legal option to compel an affordable payment may be filing for bankruptcy."
1816275,"If you are over 40 years of age the employer must allow you 21 days to consider the document, and another 7 days to change your mind after you sign it.

1800511,"If your goal is to build your credit, having your name added to the title will not accomplish that - you need to be added to the loan.  Your parents could contact the lender and ask to add you as a co-signor.  Only then will the lender report a good payment history on your credit report.   Even if you just want to add your name to the title, you may need permission from the lender.  The lender holds a lien on the car, which is stamped on the title, and any change in ownership will likely require the lender's release to re-title.  A call to the MVA should confirm this part of your question."

1819246,"Depending on how the stipulation is written, Mother may be able to.   She will have to show that there has been a ""change in circumstances"" since the last child support order was made.  Generally speaking, if the judge ordered a child support amount below the guideline amount, she can ask to change that amount at any time. You do NOT need to show a change in circumstances.  This is true even if your non-guideline child support order was reached by stipulation (agreement) between the 2 parents.  Some examples of changed circumstances are as follows:   The income of 1 or both parents has changed;  One parent has lost his or her job;  One parent has been incarcerated;  One parent had another child from another relationship;  There have been significant changes in how much time the child in the case spends with each parent;  The child's needs may have changed and there may be more (or less) costs for child care, health care, or education; and  There have been changes in any of the factors that are used to calculate child support.

1799436,"You should be able to print your call detail. Other than that you cannot get text records without a subpoena. An attorney cannot issue a subpoena without a legitimate court purpose. Even if you were in the middle of a lawsuit there is a good chance that you could not obtain these records within a month or two. They have 30 days to respond to the subpoena and when they do respond they generally send them to the court. Then you would have to get a court order to unseal the records.   With all of that being said, if she does not believe you then there is no trust in your relationship. A relationship without trust is going to fail. Please value yourself enough to get out of the relationship. She is insecure and you cannot fix that. She will have to work on herself without you. Good luck."

1804631,"You say no MOU was signed that day.  I assume that there was no written agreement at all.  There are three questions that I see:  1) Was an agreement reached?  2) Did it cover the current issue   and 3) Is it binding?  The last question is very fact specific.  An oral agreement can be binding if that is what the parties intended.  Sometimes an agreement can be enforced if one of the parties relies upon it.  I would start by contacting the mediator, and alerting him or her to the current problem.  See what the mediator advises.  If the mediator sees the current issue as something new, you can take it back to the mediator to try to work it out.    This time, I would get it in writing, signed by both parties.  If the mediator will not get involved again, and you cannot work it out with the other side, you may have to enforce the oral agreement.  If you need to do that, I would recommend that you contact a litigation attorney with experience in the area of the dispute, and get advice on the three questions I asked above."
1803154,"The general rule is that unless you have a court order establishing sole custody, or a court order specifically permitting your travel  with your son, you cannot obtain a U.S. passport for your son unless your husband signs and notarizes a statement of consent (Form DS-3053).  This is assuming your husband is on the birth certificate.    If getting your husband to consent is impossible, I think you actually would benefit more from speaking to a family law attorney about options to establish sole custody of your son (if you don't have it already, given your husband is abroad).  You may want to consider re-asking this question in the family law/child custody forum.  Good luck."

1794068,"In Massachusetts, as in other jurisdictions, there is no statute of limitations on first degree murder  so he could, indeed, be charged and incarcerated 27 years after allegedly committing the crime. If, however, the evidence were to point to his individual being charged with manslaughter it would be subject to a 6 year statute of limitations.  Unlike murder, though, arson in Massachusetts does have a 6 year statute of limitations. So this individual could not be charged with arson unless the statute of limitations has been ""tolled,"" or extended, due to some act."

2046573,"First, let me congratulate you on moving out of kansas. I am a bankruptcy attorney on the Missouri side of Kansas City and a partner at Upright Law which represents debtors all over the country. Yes, a bankruptcy can help you to discharge the kS fines and get your license back. You have 2 options:  1)  Chapter 7: This is the quick and easy type of bankruptcy that wipes out your unsecured debt and lets you move on with life after only a couple of months. Chapter 7 will not discharge the amount that you owe to kS but it will hopefully wipe out enough other debt that you will be able to pay it on your own after your chapter 7 is complete. 2) Chapter 13: This is the type that allows you to set up a payment plan. It doesn't require you to pay everybody back but it does require payments and takes 3-5 years to complete. Chapter 13 DOES discharge the fines that you owe to kS and allows you to get your license back now. We would then set up a payment plan to pay for your car or house or back taxes or whatever else you are already paying. Most people usually pay less each month to the Trustee than they would have been paying for the same stuff without the bankruptcy."

1814402,"The county Recorder of Deeds has the mortgage, and you can order a copy from them. The easiest way to get the other closing documents is to contact your current mortgage servicer (who you send your mortgage payments to) and request the documents from them. Regulation X of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 CFR å¤ 1024.36, requires mortgage servicers to respond to written information requests within a certain time period. Because there is a lot of uncertainty as to what information the servicer has to provide under Regulation X, most mortgage servicers err on the side of caution and disclose more information that they legally have to so that they do not risk sanction by the federal government.   Read 12 CFR å¤ 1024.36, which sets forth specific requirements for the form of your written request for information, and and give it a shot.

There are additional categories of income stated in the Guidelines.  Box 1 on Form W-2 represents total taxable wages or salary for federal income tax purposes. The social security wages stated in Box 3 are the total amount of wages subject to the Social Security tax.  Box 5 reports the amount of wages subject to the Medicare tax and typically represents the entire compensation from employment, including any deferred compensation, 401(k) contributions or other fringe benefits which are excluded from the federal income tax. The application of the Guidelines to your W-2 and any other income should be discussed with your lawyer and/or tax advisor."
829367,"If this is a first time DUI, there is a good chance he'll be released on his own recognizance without having to post bail, but it depends on the facts of the case, how long the warrant has been active and his past record (if any).    If they don't release him, he's entitled to a reasonable bail.  Most bond companies will charge you 10% off the street or 8% from an attorney referral.    If this warrant has been in the system for quite some time, there may also be a valid motion to dismiss the entire case for failure to prosecute him in a timely fashion - again, it depends on the facts and whether he failed to appear in court when he was supposed to or if the DA was late to file and a warrant was issued later."

Because your father was a resident of Maryland at his death, Maryland law will control what happens with his real property located in Maryland and all of his personal property. You could hire a Maryland attorney who practices estate planning, probate, or estate administration to represent you as a beneficiary and to protect your interests in that regard.  North Carolina law controls what happens with the real property in NC. Either you or your sister will need to open an ancillary estate in the county in NC where the property is located. The other of you will have to consent to this action. You could hire a NC attorney who practices estate planning, probate, or estate administration to represent you as executor of your father's ancillary estate in NC or as a beneficiary.

1800744,"I believe that you address something commonly known as the ""commerciality"" doctrine - which prohibits a nonprofit organization from operating solely for a commercial purpose in direct competition with ""for profit"" businesses.  There are two ways that most nonprofit organizations get around this doctrine. The first is that they run the commercial activity as a ""side"" business that is not substantially large - claim the income as ""unrelated business income"" and pay taxes on that income.   The second way that they can avoid application of the doctrine is to RELATE the business activity in some way to their exempt purpose, i.e. educating & training students in the art of graphic design.  My guess is that the school has made the determination that their activity is substantially related to their exempt purpose (education) and reported that activity as such to the IRS."

1811160,"The lien isn't automatically stripped. A motion needs to be filed, properly served, and the judge needs to enter an order that says the lien will be stripped at discharge. This normally happens before confirmation, near the beginning of the case. You need to show the court evidence of the house value, the senior liens, and proof that the lien to be stripped is completely unsecured.   The time at which the property is valued is typically upon the filing of the case in a chapter 13 (in chapter 11s some courts have been ordering that valuations occur at confirmation). But in any case, if you have a lien strip order, from a properly filed motion, the property rising in value won't affect the lien and won't cause it not to be stripped at the end. But it's not automatic, you need that motion to have been filed and the order to have been entered.  Hope that helps!"

With all due respect, it is not fair of you to expect your lawyer to work for free. The court will not likely force her to do so.  Sometimes, judges will not allow lawyers to withdraw in cases where the client has constitutional right to an attorney and the withdrawal can cause delays or serious issues. That would be in a criminal case.  Rarely will a judge stop a lawyer from withdrawing in a civil case."
1824789,"Two things. Your mother (best through a lawyer) can motion the court to vacate the judgment on the basis that she is elderly; appeared in the court room but not go before the judge because she was confused and thought talking to the Plaintiff's lawyer was sufficient.  I don't know the equity situation in your home but judgment liens can be avoided in bankruptcy if her 1/3 equity is less than $15,000."
1132074,"You will need to schedule an appointment with a local employment attorney. As an independent contractor, the deaf worker may have reduced rights. Normally you would need to offer what is called a ""reasonable accommodation."" This is not always such a clear standard and your answer will be extremely fact specific in the end."
1804321,"It would be your burden to prove that this party fraudulently/intentionally procured these royalties.   This would be difficult because they will claim that they relied upon the title opinion and expertise of the oil company and their attorneys.  A better strategy would be to file for quiet title, prove your rights in court, and attempt to recover damages from both the oil company and other mineral owner."
1816421,It seems that their conduct constitutes nuisance.   I agree with Mr. Ashouri in that you can report the incident to the appropriate state agency.  The website for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety is http://www.permitla.org/csr.
1815956,"This is a good question that comes up more often than not. The reason the hospital is not releasing any information is because of HIPPA regulations. Without direct authorization, a HIPPA release or a power of attorney, the hospital is unable to give out any information about the patient. Hopefully, he has directed that someone has the authority to make healthcare decisions for him. If not, a guardian will have to be appointed by the court. I hope this helps."
1799016,"Since your probation expires on June 18, 2015, the only way to get relief through PC 1203.4 is to get an early termination of probation first.  Otherwise, you have to wait until your probation has been successfully completed.  Since you have done everything and have good cause (job) to ask, you should retain an attorney to file a Motion for Early Termination and Expungement.  Understand that if you need to be licensed by the state to do your job, you will still have to reveal it."
2580071,"Hello.  You seem to be a loving parent.   What a crisis - you cannot retrieve time lost with your child.  In my professional work it is not uncommon that one parent will present to me thinking that the other parent 'is the law'.  Reality is you're 'choosing' what is happening, & you may begin to make other decisions.    I urge you to choose a very well experienced attorney to help you. In my professional work I may assist clients pursuant to a written limited scope attorney services agreement:  This sort of work I do includes the aim of cost effectiveness & attorney help  that is within the financial means of the client.  Such work is not done by many attorneys fyi.   So you know Hennepin County has had a pilot study, initiated many years back now.  I suggest you check a few att'y website bio' pages, make a few contacts, choose an att'y for yourself.  Be aware that if you reside in a somewhat remote area, a very few of us routinely make special arrangements to assist such people.  Do be wary of 'free advice'.   Best to you & your precious child !!           Tricia Dwyer Esq"
1813803,"My colleague is correct. The only thing I would add is that based upon this situation, you need to bring this matter back before the Court to modify the visitation. Speak to a local attorney immediately as the potential for harm to the child is great. Also, if you do nothing then you could be charged with contempt for allowing visitation to continue without court intervention."

1815664,"You may be disappointed to learn that there isn't a single right answer to this question. Like all legal rights, your rights to parenting time are only as good as your ability to enforce them. It certainly sounds like you have a good argument that you should see your daughter this weekend, under the terms of the court's order. By your own account, though, the other parent has already been violating the previously-existing orders. This shows you that having a court order, by itself, doesn't answer these questions.   Putting this in practical terms: You can contact your co-parent and say, Hey, according to the order which you yourself sought, I'm supposed to have our daughter every other weekend; I didn't have her last weekend, so when shall I get her for this one? If she refuses to let you do so, that's one more point to raise with the court at an enforcement hearing, which, as I understand it, you're already trying to arrange.   It's good that you're seeking an attorney's assistance with this - you should direct your questions to them. They're bound to be able to give you a better answer, knowing the whole case, than anyone can knowing only a few sentences over the internet."
1509663,"If only the social security payment is deposited in that account and is traceable directly to it, then you should prevail at a hearing, the social security is exempt. Ensure that you have not comingled any other funds in that account and that your social security is clearly identifiable and traceable."
1799380,"Yes.  In Tennessee, in order for an adoption to occur, the parental rights of the parent must be terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily.  To involuntarily terminate, the petitioners must prove at least one ground and that termination is in the best interests of the child.  There are several grounds on which to file and several factors that the court considers to determine the child's best interest.  The parents must be served with the petition, and if their whereabouts are unknown, they can be served through publication.  As long as service requirements are met, you may proceed without her consent in the event that she fails to appear or otherwise file pleadings as required by law.  The process will be similar for both children.  A name change is an alternative to adoption, and may be available in your case.  The process is substantially faster and less cumbersome than is an adoption.  In addition, a name change does not terminate the rights of a parent nor does it cut off the inheritance rights that arise from the parent/child relationship.  The statutory requirements for termination and adoption as outlined in Tennessee Code Annotated 36-1-113 and 36-1-116 respectively are very specific and must be met with no exceptions.  Therefore, you need to retain a seasoned adoption attorney to aid you in this process."
1812450,I am not confident that the question contains enough information for an accurate answer.  Your question  could arise out of a creditor's claim in a probate or bankruptcy or it could just be a lawsuit on a debt.  In each case the answer could be different.  There is just not enough information conveyed for us to be helpful.
1817697,You can contact Legal Aid or other provider of services to someone of limited income.  Another option is to engage counsel that will try to secure an order requiring the spouse to cover your legal fees.
1816571,The answer depends on the circumstances. If the first Will was submitted to probate In Solemn Form and the appropriate persons received notice before it was probated you have a very limited time to Contest the Will or submit another Will. If the Will was probated in Common Form the time is not as limited. You should contact an attorney who handles probate and will contest cases as soon as possible.
1790659,"Probably not, but you should be prepared to explain any discrepancy."
1798423,The court does not care unless you made a court appearance and you were ordered not to leave the state. Since the arrest was recent that does not appear to be the case. You probably signed agreement with bail agent. Hire an attorney in your area to discuss specifics.
1825900,"Residents in a Covenant community do not ever ""sign"" a HOA contract as it is part of the deed that the resident who purchases in such a community shall abide by the covenants ""rules"".  The HOA is permitted to sue anyone who fails to abide by the covenants or place a lien on someones property for fines,  unpaid fees, or costs for the HOA to take corrective action should the resident fail to follow the rules.  In addition, any resident may sue another resident for the same things as the rights in the covenants belong to each homeowner and HOA is just an part of the community with authority to act on behalf of the community as a whole.  If someone who lives in such a community does not like the rules or covenants, then their only options are to either move out of the community or try to raise enough support to vote in changes to the rules."
1950922,"When you reaffirmed the debt, you re-assumed personal liability which was discharged in BK.  If reaffirmation valid, you are again personally liable. If C7 BK is closed, you may re-open, move to vacate reaffirmation, explain details of non-existent investor.  You may also file adversary against non-existent adversary and other parties and have this resolved by BK court.  This may be most efficient means of solving this.  You may also file quiet title action in Superior Court.  Consult BK counsel before proceeding with either action.or Court."
1797312,"If you told the police you were uncertain but you gave a name as a possible culprit, that is different than telling the police you know without a doubt it was neighbor Fred because you were trying to protect friend Tom, then deciding you actually need better friends anyway."
1804176,"I agree with brother counsel. You should speak with a Medical Malpractice Attorney. In Connecticut a ""certificate of good faith inquiry"" is required to prosecute a medical malpractice claim. What this means is that a Medical professional (the same type that did the damage) has to agreed that the standard of medical care was violated. You ,nor your lawyer can proceed without this . The fact that you have a comment from another doctor indicating ""carelessness"" suggests that you may have a viable claim. Speak to a lawyer who can review all of the material and procure a ""certificate of good faith inquiry."" Good luck."
1809514,You can travel with a Canadian passport and a US green card as long as you have not be out of the US for an extended period of time.
1814461,"If the police were not involved at the outset, they usually will not be involved later.  The letter Walmart referred to is a civil demand for payment of Walmart's expenses for their loss prevention fees.  If you do not receive this letter, great.  Do not hire an attorney to ask for it, unless you really just think you should pay Walmart up to $500 for this.    What you did was certainly a crime.  It is a crime to steal."
1792547,"No surprise that we all think you should retain counsel right away.  As I explain to client's, we can help avoid the land mines in the case, but if you have already blown your leg off, we may not be able to put it back on.  Get counsel to help avoid problems."
1796523,Yes-if the power is stated in the trust and you have become the trustee. You should meet with a medicaid attorney to discuss how to protect the money and also qualify him for medicaid. You might not have to spend down all the assets.
2246762,At least 4 months maybe longer. 6 months at the outset. If you're having problems I suggest you have an immigration attorney help you with the FOIA. I've done this for clients who have lost documents and to see what steps need to be taken next.
1805385,"Those sorts of details are often best worked out at sentencing. That is when judges allow or deny stays of execution, and allow or deny weekend or work release jail service. Getting back in front of a judge to change that judges order is not always easy, and near impossible the day of the jail service. She waited until the last minute to try to get help, which severely limits her options."
1796564,"Don't post any further details.  Licensing agencies and law enforcement can and do look at the web, just like everyone else.    BNDD is one of the toughest licensing nuts to crack.  There are several attorneys in the Jefferson City area that handle these types of cases.  You have a fight on your hands and there is going to be a hole in your wallet.    You have gone from criminal law to administrative law and the rules are very different."
1797251,"It sounds like the government has started a collection proceeding against you to seize your assets to make payment toward restitution. This is a civil proceeding, and you are not entitled to court-appointed counsel. If you cannot afford counsel, you may want to contact legal aid offices in your area to see if they can help you.  Don't worry about what you don't have--taxes, personal property.  Just bring what you do have--try to prepare an accurate accounting of your assets, income, etc.  The AUSA will question you about your assets in order to determine if you have anything subject to seizure.  If you have nothing, then you have nothing to be seized. Just be sure that the information you supply to the court is complete and accurate."
1815545,"I work as a defense lawyer and have had to explain this to my clients on a number of occasions.  Candidly, your mother should hire her own counsel to protect her assets and her interests.  In fact, she should have already received a letter from the insurance company's adjuster advising her to do that very thing. I can see from your question that the adjuster has not been keeping her up to date on the handling of the case.  I would counsel her to contact the adjuster and make an appointment to go and review her file with her own personal counsel present.  The affidavit is something that she should have input on from her own personal attorney."
1805141,You may wish to respond with a letter from your employer that states your current pre-tax salary.
1799307,It's impossible to give more than a general answer in the absence of specific information about the charges. So this is a very general answer. The kind of ethical violations that get attorneys suspended or disbarred usually involved stealing the client's money or having been convicted of a felony. Lesser offenses more often result in some form of public censure.
1817628,"The other attorneys here are correct, but one important question would be what is the reason for your question? If you are trying to get this person prosecuted for a crime, then that would be up to the Prosecutor in your area. If you are trying to get a marriage voided, then you would have to have standing to contest the validity of the marriage in a civil suit."
1807319,Sounds fishy to me as all mortgages are recorded in the county in which the real property is located. As to the divorce check the clerk of court website under a name search and you will be able to verify whether a divorc case was filed.
1813907,I am a Federal Workers Compensation Attorney and the FECA prohibits contingency fees. We can only bill on an hourly basis and our fee must be approved by the OWCP before we can collect the fee from the injured worker.
1802754,"Additional information is needed, please. Criminal? Civil? Reversed, or remanded?"
1796153,"Yes, if probable cause exists, it is permissible to search a location based on the address. Yes, if they have probable cause to make an arrest, a person can be arrested in a public place. If he was arrested and was not read his rights, the impact of this would be the potential to exclude any statements he may have made.   If he didn't make a trip police were relying on him making based on the informant's information, that may help diminish the credibility of anything else the informant said.  A bigger question than whether your boyfriend lived in that house is whether he had access and any control over that property, irrespective of where he actually resides.  Your boyfriend needs counsel. That is no small amount of heroin."
1810604,"You do have some rights in the car, possibly under an implied lease, if there was an agreement for you to maintain the car, or otherwise you needed to repair the car when he ""gave"" it o you.  You can sue your dad for title, but it would be costly.  A court can determine who has the most interest and if you have put value in the car, whether expected by your dad or not, he could pay you for that added value (""quantum meruit"").  There might be more practical ways to get a car of your own though instead of spending the money on a law suit, which might or might not end up benefiting you in the end."
1801025,"You are treated as having predeceased him.  The stepchildren are no longer step children, but he made have made different provisions in the will--have to look at the exact language in regards to them and how they are identified in the will."
1845811,"Your paranoia may be giving you good advice. I remember from my own old L1A extension days that they kept me so busy I was hardly even aware that the extension process was happening. And if that is the case for you, then you are doing the job you came here to do, and it is going well and likely to be approved. If your paranoia is based on what you see in your company rather than whispers from friends or from the internet, then maybe things don't look so good. This whole process makes you paranoid. Most people go through the worry. But you have to keep in mind that the process is fair and not ""arbitrary and capricious."" - it's not about chances. It's about credibility."
1819099,"That is one of the risks you take when operating as a sole proprietorship.  There is no distinction that can be made between you and your business.  Unless state exemption laws provide some protection for you, you are out of luck.  Hope this perspective helps!"
1739537,Usually a local attorney will best be able to handle your issue. There is value in knowing the local customs (and often in knowing the local judges).   And I'm located in Visalia.
1812451,"The fact that the photos were produced in black and white does not preclude their introduction at trial in color. They must, however, be properly authenticated."
1800017,"It's not easy to prove medical malpractice, period.... The mistakes in surgical cases are particularly to prove... There is another problem for your case, which is that you have sustained a relatively modest injury sufficient to justify the prosecution of a medical malpractice case. .... As one of the commentators on AVVO once remarked, 'almost died' then you almost have a case....The law in CA too is not too hospitable to these claims....  I am sorry about your experience... And i hope you are all better now."
2201110,"I hate to disagree with fellow attorneys, but you DO need help, and fast.  Collection laws are complicated and they get confusing in a hurry. You may have defenses to their claims.  You should consider talking to a consumer protection attorney. I suggest going to http://www.consumeradvocates.org/find-attorney and find an attorney in your area who handles FDCPA, FCRA, or cases involving Credit Cards. Considering the fact that most consumer protection statutes pay for your attorney's fees, there is no reason to have to muddle through this on your own. Depending on the circumstances, some attorneys will take your case at no charge."
1814854,"I see you posted this in Wheeling, my former home town. There is a very knowledgeable family law lawyer there. Theresa Teraseva. Give her a call.  Your post does not have enough facts for a definitive answer. If you divorced him and got an order restoring your maiden name, that is your name.  If you are saying your divorce was never finalized. Then your name is the name you adopted when you married. You may have to go back to the clerk of the court where you tried to get a divorce.  If your husband died with you and he still married, I agree that you probably need a name change  proceeding. You may use my name with Theresa..  If it is a name change, also perhaps Andy Jackson since that actioni would be in circuit court. Andy is not a family law lawyer."
1821751,A charge off simply means the original creditor has written off their books. You are still liable for the debt and a collection agency (debt buyer) has been assigned to collect.  You can notify the new collector in writing that they cease communication with you and that should stop the calls.
1816003,"Another resource you may want to try is ailalawyer.com, which is from the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  That directory has a drop down menu based on areas of immigration law.  Good luck."
2139238,"leave it blank and then handwrite ""present"" in the box. It is the best we can do. : )  MY office then completes the form with overlapping jobs if there are two at the same time. For instance, lins one says ""ACME -- JUly 2014 present_ line 2 says ""Dog walker"" August 2014 - present."""
1808198,"There can be a number of reasons why an attorney can cease representation and as noted, the terms of that contract will control and hopefully speak to the issue. If this is part of ongoing litigation it can get more complicated. I agree that you should consult a lawyer in private, but consider that you most certainly do not want to press a lawyer to work for you once they have indicated they do not wish to. This is almost never in your favor.   I suggest that you consult with a lawyer in private and discuss your objectives in more detail. You can start by calling around to several for a free phone consultation, get some insights then pick the best fit to work with.   Best regards,  Frank Natoli-Lapin, LLC"
1713553,"No.  That means that if nothing is done in the case by that date it will be dismissed by the Court.  It is up to the litigants and their attorneys (if applicable) to move the process through.  If nothing happens and/or their is no judgment by that date, the court will hold a hearing to determine if the case should be dismissed.  In essence it is a control date."
1816119,"Previously asked and answered.  Again, simply means that USCIS has decided to ""reaffirm"" (restate again, repeat anew) it's previous approval of the petition in question (despite the fact that the US consulate overseas, in its infinite wisdom, had decided to ""re-adjudicate"" (take another deep look) at CIS' approval; decided something was wrong and that CIS should not have approved the petition, made them know why in their notes & conclusions to CIS, sent the petition back to CIS with a recommendation for CIS to revoke the petition. Now CIS, most likely after having issued a ""notice of Intent to Deny"" and giving you 30 days to respond, has decided to reaffirm its initial approval of the petition, most likely after having received a very thorough rebuttal from your attorney, and made its decision known to the consulate. Congratulations! Finally, the ""ball ""is now is in the Consulate's court of whether to reconsider its previous decision to deny the visa and issue it now, in light of the fact of CIS having reaffirmed its initial approval of the petition.  Best of luck!"
1804153,"I would say it depends on why the mistakes happened.  If the 70 year old client is having trouble conveying the facts to the lawyer, so the lawyer has to keep making adjustments, that isn't the lawyer's fault.  If the lawyer has been told the facts correctly and completely, but keeps making mistakes, that is another issue. In either case, the way to deal with it is to tell the lawyer about the concerns. But this would have to come from the client."
1814368,"Almost all debt incurred during your marriage here in Washington is community liability! That includes a student loan assuming you are not separated at the time of the debt but married.   As a result, if you divorce, you want the divorce decree to state your spouse shall pay that debt timely and not late and indemnify you from it.   Only assets obtained during a divorce are community assets. However, that may affect possible later child support if any kids and later modifications if the spouses money increases. It may also affect your maintenance if any.   Finally, you don't really say whether you want or need to file bankruptcy; if so, I strongly suggest you find an attorney who practices bankruptcy full time and is experienced as the issue is whether you file before you divorce is final and obtain a discharge beforehand..there are many issues related to that.   Some attorneys, like myself , do NOT charge to talk to you . Some can speak to you over the weekend like us also!  Good luck."
1821414,"You need to speak to an immigration attorney who also handles coram nobis petitions in Virginia. Although 14 years may be old, no attorney can say definitively that it's impossible to reopen the case to reduce the sentence. You'll need an attorney to review the record, transcripts, to start."
1803378,Its possible but most prosecutors wouldn't find the case very attractive.  If this happened in Green County your law enforcement and prosecutors are among the best in the state.  If they aren't willing to take it on no one will.
1801596,"If you begin divorce proceedings in the middle of pendency of your JOINT I-751 Petition to remove conditions, you may ask to SWITCH the basis of your I-751 Petition with USCIS from Joint to Waiver. But, before you can switch - you must have proof that you started your divorce. Once you have the proof that divorce is on its way - you must call USCIS at 1-800-375-5283 and report that you wish to switch the basis for your petition to remove conditions. In addition, you must write a letter attaching the summons and index number for your divorce and request to switch the basis in writing (to the service center that's written on your I-751 receipt notice).  It's best to have this done with an immigration attorney. In addition, in certain situations where the beneficiary like yourself is experiencing abuse in their marriage at the hands of their USCIS spouse - I simultaneously file a VAWA (Abused Spouse Self Petition) and add a new basis to the I-751 waiver - the abuse basis for a waiver. We offer free consultations to clients - please feel free to call me directly."
1816292,"Do you have any documentation of your attempts to transfer?  My only concern is that coming in on an F visa and not even going to a school may suggest you misrepresented to immigration in order to get into the country. Don't try and guess whether the case is easy or hard. Don't ask the internet. Go see an immigration attorney. The other big issue that USCIS really care about is that the marriage is a long term commitment, and not an arrangement for a green card. Gathering and presenting the evidence that your marriage is real is the big challenge facing many couples, and a professional can really help with this. Good luck."
1801605,"Charges can be dropped, the prosecutor just believes that is not the correct thing to do.  This is why people need someone to defend their legal case.  This system is adversarial, meaning they try to convict, sometimes wrongly, and you need someone to defend, even if you know you did not do this.  Consider: the prosecution does not have the insight you posses of knowing your innocence, they go on what they think is the best evidence.  If you are right, and you have a competent attorney on your side, it should get dropped, but not perhaps as quickly as you think it should be or would like.  Defense attorneys investigate the case beyond what has been done already by exposing alleged victims, police, and witnesses to sworn depositions that hopefully will induce the prosecutor to drop and move on, and possibly forensic analysis where either none has occurred or results are not determinative.  Get an attorney, don't post actual facts on line, and good luck.  We offer free consults."
1794318,"You cannot incur debt in anticipation of filing for BK.  That debt cannot be discharged.  At the same time, the company is likely going to cancel the card once you file.  Before you file for BK you should talk with a lawyer.  Given the fact that you do not have a job there might not be any recourse against you by the creditor.  Plus, if you have more than a couple of hundred dollars, the trustee will take that.  Talk with a lawyer and explain the whole situation."

1814657,"As already mentioned, they can (and most likely will) resubmit the blood for a full toxicology panel to show use of drugs including marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, and some prescription drugs.  You will need an attorney to determine your best course of action/defense if the panel comes back positive as there are many factors to consider in any DWI case.  They will review the blood panel along with the conditions for the stop, any video which may exist of the arrest/field sobriety test and determine the best course of action from there.  The bottom line is, consult with an attorney (if you haven't done so already) to help you fight the case."
1796450,"There is no automatic way to get relief. You should contact the agent you worked with to see what they suggest that they are willing to do. In essence, you signed as a guarantor and are responsible to the bonding company until they relieve you, or the court orders you relieved of the obligation."
1827332,This needs a lawyer and needed one from the start.  A motion and argument needs to be made and my feeling is that this was made worse without having counsel.  Probation and Parole revocation hearings are very important and as someone who has handled quite a lot of these I can say with confidence that a good lawyer would have most likely prevented this current situation.  Call someone for a consult for help.  It is normally free and you will get the information you need to make the best choice.  This situation illustrates the importance of counsel better than most.
1802278,"Contact the clerk's office about resetting your court date. That shouldn't be a problem. if it is hire an attorney, and the attorney can easily reset the court date. Your ""excuse"" does not carry any legal weight, but may help with a reduction. The judge would simply say you were the one that got caught. In either event ask the prosecutor to reduce your charge to a non-reporting violation so the charge does not go on your driving history."
1825352,"I respectfully disagree with the previous answer. It may be that way in NY, but in NY, if charges are dismissed, they are not automatically sealed. Any arrest is public record and can show up on a background check. The only way to clear that is to file for an expungement. From what you have told us, it sounds like you are a candidate to have this charge expunged. Speak with a local criminal defense attorney about how to start the process. Good luck to you!"
1799242,"If the separate lot on which the garage was constructed has it's own block and lot number, there are a couple pf possible explanations that come too mind. The first is that the there never were any DOB filings because permits were never obtained, or other filings made, for the garage construction; or DOB  lost the papers filed, or never entered them into the BIS system on it's website, or entered them under the wrong block and lot number. I have had situations where each of these situations have occurred, and some can present significant problems that you would be better off addressing now, rather than later. I suggest that you or someone on your behalf physically go to your County's DOB office and find out if there are any filings or C of Os for the garage, or any papers filings at all on it's Block and Lot number. Good luck!"
1803916,"Thirty days is the usual time, and should be written on the first page of the demands.  Discovery is a self regulated process between attorneys usually, and presumably between a party and opposing party if unrepresented (though not sure about that).  The parties can stipulate to extend time to answer demands if necessary."

1818842,"During the first two years after the Judgment of Divorce there is a higher standard that a party must meet if s/he wants to change custody and/or visitation. That party must prove by substantial evidence ""that the modification is necessary because the current custodial conditions are physically or emotionally harmful to the best interest of the child"", instead of the standard ""best interest"" test. This motion ought to be dismissed. If you don't feel that you will be able to speak your piece, then by all means, find an attorney in your county who has a substantial family law practice."

1799616,"It could be a significant problem for you if your contract with this person is not in writing. There are a myriad of legal concerns with finding terms to enforce where those terms are ""casual"" or verbal, as your question suggests. There may not even be an enforceable contract at all, depending on the rest of the facts. That said, oral contracts can be enforceable, their terms are just far more difficult to prove. Consider looking for related correspondence that references the contract and the agreements (such as emails, text messages, or letters). Also consider sending confirming emails or letters to this person with the terms of your contract spelled out, and requesting that this person abide by that agreement. Not as good as evidence at the time of the contract formation, but depending on the response that could be helpful to help establish a contract.  You can sue for breach of contract for any payments past due. If there has been a material breach of the entire contract, or if there is an acceleration or similar clause in your contract, you may be able to sue for the full amount of the contract.  I hope that this is helpful. Good luck to you."
1798639,"Absent a contractual agreement, most employment in New York is considered to be employment at will. In an employment at will situation, a person can be terminated at any time, without reason. However, there are a number of exceptions to an employment at will termination. If someone is being terminated and that person's civil rights have been violated in any way, such as age discrimination, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, race or gender discrimination, etc. Also, if termination is any way retaliatory for whistle blowing or some other act, an employer may be liable for wrongful discharge. There may be reasons why you have been terminate that your ex-employer would never state to avoid liability. If you think you have been discriminated against in any way, if there has been any form of whistle blowing or if you want to fully vet the facts that led up to your termination, it would be in your best interest to consult with a labor and employment attorney. Such vetting would give you a full understanding of your legal rights. Most Attorneys will give you a free initial consultation.   Best of Luck!  William J.

You are right to worry about health options, and they vary state to state. After 5 years she could ""buy in"" to medicaid. She is not excluded from the exchanges by the fact that she would be a newly arrived LPR. But I expect she wouldn't be working.  Healthcare is the biggest reason why people rarely if ever retire to the United States. Some state based health services use a concept called PRUCOL to decide whether people can get access. And they may use the affidavit of support to reimburse their costs. You have a very difficult decision ahead of you and you are right that ""what happens after' is the most important part.  Get some advice from local health organizations. Good luck"
1814314,I think the best practice is to register the domain name as an assumed name for your LLC.  Since you did not register the domain name as an assumed name for you personally there does not need to be any registered transfer of the assumed name.  If you feel the domain name has a value you could do an agreement between yourself and the LLC allowing the LLC to use the domain but retaining ownership personally.

Until a divorce or legal separation are filed, either one of you can take the children anywhere you want (within the U.S.) without the consent to the other parent.  If you file a pleading for divorce or legal separation, generally, the creates an injunction preventing either party for leaving the state without the other parent's consent.

You may not have the resources to be approved for the affidavit of support on your own, and would likely need a joint sponsor. Your mum may or may not be able to help since the amount she has to earn to qualify depends on the number of dependents she has in her household.

Otherwise, there is nothing to give it dies when she dies.  If it was a defined contribution plan (401k, 457, etc.) then there is something potentially for the heirs to get.  Sounds like a DB so nothing to leave anyone other than potentially a spouse.  You should be able to take the  paperwork regarding your mom's pension to any good family law or general practice lawyer and they should be able to figure out whether this is a DB or DC plan.

Because the home has a statutory homestead, if you want to levy on the house, you must be prepared to pay, in cash, the amount of the homestead exemption.  In addition to hiring an attorney, you will need to hire an appraiser so that you can convince the judge that there is equity in the home above the amount of the homestead exemption.  For a more specific estimate, you need to meet with an attorney and review the details."
1813046,"The judge has made a decision, and, since the other party does not like the result, they are now requesting oral argument.  This is basically an appeal of the judges decision, although the family court is unlikely to reopen the matter for oral argument.

The chance of being convicted depends on a lot of things, the least of which is the charged offense (in and of itself). A record is rarely helpful to the defendant, but the fact that he has a record doesn't change my answer."
1797191,"Unless you have recently been arrested or charged with a new crime, the most likely explanation for the rejection is probably some aspect of the PTD that you inadvertently failed to comply with. For example, maybe you were supposed to be under supervision and never checked in, or maybe you were supposed to provide proof of completion of one or more conditions within a certain amount of time. Whatever the situation is, make sure you keep the documents that prove you completed your conditions so that you can present them when you go to court. Keep calm and remain courteous when explaining what happened; it may be that the State will honor the agreement anyway once you show that you did everything. If not, you will at that point need the services of an attorney to help you determine how to proceed."

1802936,"You are under no obligation to return the originals to the attorney.  Often, attorneys will keep the originals for clients as a way to ensure repeat business:  when the client dies, his or her family will have to go to the attorney for the estate planning documents, and chances are, they will hire that attorney to administer the estate.  Once you've concluded your business with the attorney the engagement is over.  Of course, sending him a copy for his files is fine."

You don't give any details about relations between you and your wife, but if you bring the children and their is any sort of incident  you could be held responsible because you knowingly violated a court order.

Next, the fault issue. Obviously, it is better for you if you aren't at fault. In Florida, adjusters (or ultimately a jury if there are injuries) can apportion fault between the parties based on the statements the parties give. It is kind of hard to tell from your facts if you checked your mirrors or looked over your shoulder to see if the lane was clear before moving into it. At the end of the day, it will probably be your version of the story against the other driver's, so you may want to reflect on the minutes before the crash and exactly what you remember about your actions and the other driver's actions. If there were any conversations about how it happened while you were still at the scene, maybe make some notes while it is fresh in your mind. If you have any questions or concerns, contact an attorney directly as soon as possible."
911183,"As others have said, your insurance company is there to assist you.  If you lose, they will pay.  They may also appeal on your behalf and provide an attorney at the appeal hearing.

Yes, there are situations (such as a H-1B holder who applies for AOS - the H-1B remains valid as long as you work for the sponsoring employer and you are also in H-1B status) but your situation is not one of them.  The moment the P-2 status is approved, your status would be changed to P-2 (as long as an I-94 is issued).  It is not possible to be in both O and P status at the same time, the last action rule prevents it from happening."

Based on the information, and I'm sure a dozen other criteria, the insurance company will make a determination as to whether they want your business and how much they will charge.  2- You can charge for the lost, stolen, or damaged product if it is agreed upon in writing.  Your rental contract has to have a provision that clearly states that you can charge their credit card for items that are lost, stolen, or damaged.  3- Conceptually, you would have to get an attorney in every state where you rent your items.  A large majority of attorneys are only licensed in one state.  Collection cases are based on contract and an attorney would have to be licensed in the state were the renter resides.

1926887,"The DMV may or may not use the Georgia prior against you.  It really depends on whether GA is a participant in the ""Interstate Driver's License Compact"" (Compact).  Under the Compact, participant states share your information and will use prior convictions or DMV suspensions to increase punishment.   A quick Google search indicates that GA is not a participant (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_License_Compact#States_that_are_not_members).   This may be why the DMV told you that the GA prior will not be used against you.    As to your trial, the GA prior must be pled an proved, which means the DA in CA must (1) allege that you have a prior conviction and (2) obtain the certified records of your conviction to prove that you in fact have a prior conviction.  You should be on notice if they are going to allege your prior conviction because it should be alleged in your criminal complaint.    Prior convictions are potent character evidence in any criminal trial.  If the DA is going to allege your GA prior, you have the option of ""waiving jury"" on the prior conviction so that the jury does not hear evidence of your prior conviction."

But if there's no jurisdiction over the husband, there can be no division of property outside the state and no determination of child support (unless he agrees to Washington's exercise of jurisdiction over him). Either way, you'll have to serve him (or have him accept service or join the petition).   So what to do next depends on what you're trying to accomplish. I suggest you invest in a legal consultation with a competent attorney as there's a lot to consider."

2152868,"You are way ahead of the curve.   Judges in traffic courts see so many defendants who chronically procrastinate about resolving such matters. The fact that you took immediate action to resolve the out of state ticket shows incredible respect for the court system and a desire to be law abiding.  Judges like that.   Moreover, any documentation you can provide that shows the date of the AZ ticket citation as well as the payment date will help the Judge to put context around your claim of good faith.   It is amazing how being the motorist with a valid license and documentation of a history of proactive compliance with DMV and Court orders in a room full of naredowells tends to lead to good things.  You sound like a productive person so any evidence of your employment or family for the Judge to review probably would not hurt either.   An attorney may help you to put all of this together in a more persuasive presentation but you sound like you are on top of things.    As to your misdemeanor issue California Vehicle Code Sec 12500(a) driving without a license is an infraction and a lesser included offense of the suspended or expired license charge that you may persuade a prosecutor or judge to let you enter.  Also, some judges and prosecutors will allow you to continue the hearing for the purpose of completing some community service and will often agree to dismiss the matter outright when that happens. Bring with you suggestions of a location where such community service could be performed and you may be pleasantly surprised with the result.   Finally, just a point of art,  in your presentation I would leave out the part about ""... the next day, I DROVE to Arizona..."" as technically your license was still suspended/expired. ""I immediately made arrangements to appear at the AZ DMV the following day..."" has a much sweeter John Q. Citizen ring to it, wouldn't you agree?  Best of luck.   *Not intended as legal advice.

As far as your situation, you should not be paying any child support if your children are over 24 and out of the house.  If you haven't already, you need to have your children declared emancipated, so the child support stops.   It probably should have stopped long ago.   You don't mention what your arrearages are.

That is probably why the officer approached them and it sounds like they may well have been trespassing.  I know that what the officer did feels extremely intrusive, but if she was trespassing, then the officer did nothing legally wrong.  (She was within her rights not to consent to the search but he was within his authority to arrest her, assuming she was trespassing ... he was then allowed to search the backpack incident to the arrest.) Her concern should be the criminal charge.  It will be handled in juvenile court and she will be entitled to a public defender.  Or, you or her parents can hire a private attorney for her."

1815313,"Aggravated Assault is heard at the Superior Court level, Simple Assault is heard at the Municipal Court level and typically gets heard sooner. It is part of a typical defense practice to file a charge against the person who foiled against you, to try to force a mutual dismissal or another type of favorable resolution. You should consult (and maybe retain) an experienced criminal defense lawyer to represent you, to argue that the charges need to be consolidated with the charges you filed against them. You do not want this moving forward without being consolidated. If you hit him, it may be self-defense, but it will likely be argued by his attorney as a separate assault and not self-defense. Alternatively you can call the victim-witness unit at the county prosecutor's office and ask if the prosecutor will move to consolidate since this may have been done to retaliate against you (in essence a type of witness-tampering type argument). I changed the category of law to criminal defense where I think you will get more responses from other lawyers."

Federal courts have repeatedly held that, in the case of state convictions, if the state grants a person a full restoration of civil rights, complete certificate of rehabilitation, or complete expungement, etc., that person is not prohibited from possessing firearms.  This question is answered by looking to the law of the State of Illinois, not federal law.  I would suggest contacting one of the Illinois criminal defense lawyers listed on Avvo to determine if Illinois has such a procedure.

There may be SOME hope if the heirs of the estate recognize your position and are willing to make some concessions. It may also be possible that you have some claims against the estate. For example, if you paid funeral expenses or any other administrative expenses of the estate, then you would be entitled to reimbursement. You may also have a claim for renovations, repairs or other expenses that you have paid in terms of preserving estate assets.

1792286,"Wisconsin is a community property state, although we call it ""marital"" property. This does not mean that everything becomes 50/50 after the marriage. Instead each spouse retains, as their respective individual property, what they brought to the marriage. The key is keeping it from getting co-mingled. If the father doesn't add new spouse on any of his accounts, she has no right to control them, and his daughter as POA would. The key is to never, ever, ever, ever mix or combine their accounts. In situations such as this I would have him set up an individual revocable trust and transfer all of his assets to the trust. The daughter can then serve as co-trustee. The trust can contain provisions to benefit new spouse, but she would not be in a position of control."
1815711,"You need to have a custody agreement that can be signed by a judge and made an order of the court.  You can go to the website of the county in which your are located, and find forms for custody. If the agreement is simple, you and the other parent can complete it and file it at the courthouse. It may be worth it to consult with an attorney so it is done correctly. If you go to an attorney, even though the attorney can only represent one of you, the cost can be split between the two of you, especially if you already agree on all of the terms and just want someone to draft it and file it properly.  It is nice to see parents work out custody arrangements amicably. In the long run your child will be much better off if the two of you can continue to work together as co-parents."
1827636,This is not a workers compensation matter. If he is damaging property and/or trespassing on the property then call TE pice. Also call a landlord/tenant attorney to give him notice to move out and get that process started.
1806731,"Before I respond to your inquiry, I must state that we have not spoken, I have not reviewed the relevant documents and facts, and I do not represent you. Therefore, my discussion below is not a legal opinion, but is informational only. Finally, my discussion applies only to issues to which Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or Federal law apply, unless otherwise specified.   That being said, you are not responsible for your adult child's medical bills unless you signed a form promising the provider you would pay.  The threats and behavior of the provider appear to violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  You should send a letter, FedEx (with proof of delivery) to the provider detailing that you are not responsible for your adult daughter's bills and demanding to know why they are charging you, and stating that if it is not resolved in two weeks, that you will file a take legal action. This may get the problem resolved; if not, speak with a consumer protection attorney.  /Christopher E. Ezold/"
1818191,"No.  There are no laws against sexting in California.  Sending photos would be a legal issue, but sexting until your thumbs are sore isn't."
1814609,"Yes, if a judge finds that marriage was fraudulent and annuls it, it will be disastrous for a petition to remove conditions.  I was involved in just such a case and it went on for nearly 10 years, including a trip to the Circuit Court of Appeals.  ICE argues in immigration court (because USCIS will almost certainly deny the I-751 and put the person in removal proceedings) that there is no need to readjudicate the fraud issue since it was already decided in the annulment case.  Very difficult and very, very bad."
1808886,"If you are a party to a lawsuit and this is part of a discovery request, your attorney can make appropriate objections/motions and see what the court decides. If you are not a party to a lawsuit, absent a court order/subpoena, you do not have to comply with a request to turn over emails. If you have been served with such an order or subpoena, then you should get an attorney right away to review, object, and advise.   If this is your work email, in California, it's really the property of your employer, and you have no legal expectation of privacy in it. If it's your personal email, but you chose to log onto it through your work computer, you also lose privacy rights in the emails to a great extent in this state. California is an ""at will"" employment state, so you can also be terminated. If this has anything to do with your employer, it is imperative that you consult an attorney right away."
1514656,"The time it takes to draft a Separation Agreement varies by firm.  However, you should have been made aware of the time frame in your initial meeting(s) with the attorney - whether you actually asked or not.  Two months is ample time for any attorney - heck, two months is enough time for some Tibetan Monk to hand engrave the Separation Agreement in triplicate for you!  For our firm, the initial appointment to gather all the information we need and the options you want in the Agreement takes about 20 minutes to an hour on average.  Once we have all the information we need the turn around time to draft the agreement for your review is 24 to 48 hours.  I don't know of any attorney who drafts a Separation Agreement from scratch any more but even if yours does, two months is more than enough time to do it.  Basically, for today's lawyer, the drafting part is simply cutting and pasting the parts that are applicable to your situation.  Our firm uses a in house custom Separation Agreement designed for Corel's WordPerfect program that is part database field input and part giant library of every conceivable separation scenario.  On average, our Agreements  can be done and customized to your unique situation in less than an hour for a flat rate fee of $250 and they are better in quality than others even if priced at $2,500.  How do we know ours are better?  Simple - other attorneys routinely copy our Separation Agreement word for bloody word to use themselves.  So, two months = too long, especially with no return call."
1787271,"Regardless of that the law says and the fact that mother and father are supposed to be on equal footing, the answer is that barring material negative facts that adversely effect the child's well being in my opinion the younger the child, the more reluctant a judge would be to dramatically change things from the status quo. However, if you  are continually being jerked around and denied reasonable access that is a big factor that goes against the mother. Similarly, if you are not paying child support they will tune you out. You need to pay child support directly and the things that you mention about what you buy on your time is irrelevant to that determination. The sickness issue is usually an irritant to a judge and makes the complaining parent look petty. You do need good representation for sure. Best of luck."
1487830,"Your family is not liable in any way for sap dripping from a tree.  Sap is really no different than tree leaves.  If a leaf fell from your tree onto a neighbor's car, you would not be liable.  Sap is a natural product of a tree and it drips.  If your neighbor does not want sap on her car, tell her not to park under the tree.  If a tree limb fell on the car, you might have liability.  But that would depend on various factors.   Trees are highly valued in California.  Personally, I would tell your neighbor to quit bothering you.  If she wants to trim the tree branches that overhang her property, she can, but if she damages the tree, she could be liable for up to three times the value. Next time she comes over to complain, ask her to never come on your property again, and give her some maple syrup as a goodbye forever gift."
1808238,"Yes, that is your right and should not affect your pending adjustment of status application, however, you've got other immediate problems that you need to attend to at once, and try to salvage your green card.  I suggest you immediately seek to consult with an experienced immigration lawyer."
1814956,"A Notice of Continuance is a pleading that is prepared, not a form.  However, you should go to the self-help center at your local courthouse and someone will be able to assist you with preparing the Notice.  Please note that the hearing is not automatically continued just because you are not available.  You will have to get your ex's consent since it is his hearing and then the permission from the Court before continuing the hearing.  If he is unwilling, you will have to appear on an ex parte basis to request that the Court continue the hearing.  You should speak with an attorney or someone in the self help center to obtain more information about continuances."
1813688,"He may very well be waiting until the last minute to answer but you are right, he could be hoping to default to avoid discovery disclosures.  You should speak with a local attorney and find out what your options are BEFORE the default hearing."
1826282,"If there are existing leases in effect, you need to check those leases to see what they provide concerning security deposits by the tenants.  If the tenants are month-to-month, you will need to request that they provide a security deposit going forward.  In that case, you will be able to terminate the tenancies by thirty day notice if they fail to provide you with a security deposit.  You can also provide the tenants with a lease going forward and require a security deposit as a term of that lease."
1817353,"Yes, beneficiaries are entitled to receive copies of certain portions of the trust and an accounting.  The beneficiaries may also have some grounds for contesting expenses prior to his death, but that depends on the circumstances and facts not provided here.  Most likely, if his estate plan was done properly, his will has no impact and will not control disposition of any assets.  There also will not likely be any reading of the will like there is in the movies.  You should probably consult with a probate/trust administration attorney.  Many of us offer a free phone consultation so it's worth making a call to get more information."
1788054,"Yes. Have an attorney review the Condo Docs. (especially the Condo Trust and By-Laws).  If Trustees are not doing their job as per the Condo Docs. they often can be made to through arbitration or court proceedings.  Also, the parents of the children may be brought in to answer for their lack of supervision.   you are entitled to the quiet use and enjoyment of your home."
1805145,"Scam.  Report it to the cops.  This whole payday loan scam is rampant right now.  Tell them to mail you something on letterhead.  Maybe an email to one of your throw away email addresses to get theeir ""metadata"" and full header info.  Make sure you get it all to the cops."
1799814,"There is a concept called fair use, but it is not black and white.  It depends on how much is used, why it is used, how it is presented, etc.  The only way to be absolutely safe is to get permission.  Even a lawyer cannot absolutely predict the outcome."
1810965,What he is referring to is an attorney hired to mediate and draft a separation/divorce agreement.  It seems like he wants this done as quickly and pain-free as possible.  The problem is that you will not get the discovery and advocacy you need.  Hire your own attorney and direct him to the issues.  Explain what he may have and let him conduct thorough discovery to ensure that his financial situation is fully presented.  You or your attorney may even want to hire an investigator to look into his assets and real net worth.  The difficult but important part is divorcing (sorry for the pun) your emotions from the issues.  Attorneys have great value here as they are not connected to either party.
1806456,"You are not supposed to travel while extension is pending.  If you go out of the country, you're supposed to wait outside and get new visa stamp to come back.  So, best might be to file before you go since the H-1B extension can be filed up to 6 months in advance and do premium processing if you're in a hurry.  Get the extension approved and when you go on vacation - get new visa stamp.   You should talk to the company lawyer who is processing your case as they should know what your plans are during the extension time as it will affect their decision how to process or it may affect when you will take your vacation."
2244462,"In Maryland, where I practice, Prosecutors (called States Attorneys back East) frequently change in cases.  They retire, quit, and get promoted or transferred.  Someone else will enter or if no lawyer shows, his lawyer will ask for a continuance.  These things have always happened.  Before computers, no one knew about them.  This is a matter of State law.  I would strongly suggest that you consult with a local attorney (perhaps selected from the AVVO website resources) with experience in this area of law, to offer a free initial consultation and perhaps assist with the process. If this information was helpful to you, even if you do not like or agree with the advice, please let me know by clicking on the ""Helpful"" or ""Best Answer"" button.  Good luck!"
1820046,"Cases against custodians are generally quite difficult unless you're able to show that the custodian was doing something other than acting as a run of the mill custodian.  There has been some movement on FINRA's part to compel private issuers and broker/dealers to do something more than just put ""par"" on a custodial statement, but such rules are not intended to be retroactive.  The other issue you have is that if the distribution was from a bankruptcy or receivership, you may be barred from pursuing the claim by court order.  If there was a broker that sold this investment to you, there may well be a cause of action you can pursue in FINRA arbitration, but time is not your friend and it sounds like some has passed since the fraud was discovered.  Happy to assist further."
1789511,"Anything is possible. You should be talking to your attorney about this. First I assume you are on formal probation? if yes than it likely means a felony conviction. Formal to informal is very difficult. If you are on formal you will need to talk to your PO about your moving plans and get that approved. Probation from county to another county is common, from one state to another is more difficult. Jail would likely release you earlier than the time you will spend on the ankle bracelet. This may not work if you are employed for financial reasons. Your attorney or a new attorney should be consulted. Lots of questions here. Good luck. Hope this helps?"
1800253,"Yes, a lawyer may represent you, but if you are not present to testify at the hearing, it may be difficult for you to prevail.  Nonetheless, you may want to reach out to a lawyer.  Michael Porter in Fayetteville is very good and may be able to help you or point you in the right direction."
1593970,"My understanding is that applicants must renew their application on a routine basis to prove that they still qualify for benefits.  At the point of renewal, then the new requirements would kick in for that applicant.  This has been my experience, unless something has changed.  I hope this helps."
1800415,"You need to schedule a consultation with an experienced immigration attorney right away.  It is possible that nothing can be done.  He may have tripped the ""permanent bar"" by reentering after he was in the US without authorization after an overstay of more than 365 days.  If so, this bar is not even waivable until he has been out of the US for 10 years.  Discuss this with an experienced attorney now so you know and understand the exact situation."
1790973,"What you need to understand is that you were here on a work visa.  If the employer terminates, ideally you should depart the U.S. or move to a new employer (including consider other options to stay legally.)  If your situation is such that you cannot travel, you may seek a short stay and apply to change status for a good reason and provide documents to support your stay (in your case, you will probably need a letter from your gynec.  However, if the application was considered frivolous and denied, it will affect all future visa applications."
1814608,"Your son likely had a mild traumatic brain injury. Particularly if he lost consciousness as a result of the accident. Insurance companies routinely stonewall and lowball victims of negligence for a living. There are deadlines for filing actions against negligent parties. Your son's case absolutely warrants a consultation with an experienced personal injury attorney.  best of luck,  Doc Shah  Zaheer A. Shah, MD, JD Attorney at Law, Physician"
1792809,"Probably not. But if you want to challenge service, you're going to have to go to court to do so. Even if the judge believes your story instead of the process server's, the fact that you're in court will make it really easy to serve you properly. Best to stop worrying about service of the Complaint and start worrying about the merits of the case."
1787359,"If you recall the courthouse where the annulment was granted, you can cal the clerk's office for the courthouse, explain your situation, and see if they keep the records going back that far.  If you are not able to get anywhere with the clerk's office, then you should contact a family law attorney in LA and see if they can help you out."
1829119,"It depends. You need to look into the derivaiton rules and see whether you were a citizen at the time. If you were, you could claim your citizenship at the consulate."
1820886,Wouldn't you rather pay an attorney something nominal To prepare The contract for you and guard your interest in this transaction a seller. Seller representation usually runs about $450 from contract to closing and you have The protection of having an attorney on your side before during and after closing.

1806767,Could mean that his file has been sent to the court for determination for a projected early release.  You know that his last date is no later than exactly when his sentence expires.
1809049,"I agree with the answers above. Just wanted to note that, in case you have not done so, you can apply for employment authorization because your asylum application has been pending for over 150 days."
1817506,"The DWLS 3rd charge can probably be handled through negotiating a reduction to a traffic ticket, especially if you have your license now. However, because DWLS is a criminal charge, it could affect your probation for the Assault 4th degree conviction. Ideally, an attorney could limit the damage of a probation violation, especially since DWLS is a non-violent offense that is unrelated to the underlying conviction."
1795903,There are different types of alimony but one of the first things the court will look at is the length of the marriage.  Your marriage should be considered a short term marriage so it will be more difficult to get alimony but not entirely impossible.  The court will also look at need vs. ability to pay.  Alimony is to help with the transition from married to single life.  You will need to ask for alimony if you don't ask for it in a counter petition you will not get it.  I suggest you speak with a local family law attorney.  They will be in a better position to analyze your case based on the facts.
1804667,"Refusal without a doubt.  Once you blow .08 or higher, there is a rebuttable presumption that you were intoxicated.  It can be overcome, but the vast majority of judges will find the defendant guilty barring some unusual circumstances.  With a refusal you could still be convicted, but the heavy burden beyond a reasonable doubt rests solely on the prosecutor/officer, and you do not have to rebut a presumption of intoxication."
1798477,"It is unlikely that your previous, now almost 20 year old overstay will still be in CBP's database. Unless you misrepresented or withheld any facts in filling out your ESTA application, go ahead and travel to the US for vacation. But do so at your own risk, knowing that you might be closely questioned by CBP should anything ""pop up"" in their database."
1804844,"It's a highly irregular sentence on a petty offense for a Judge to order random urine screens.  However, the good news is that you were found Not Guilty of the major offenses which were 2 Class A Misdemeanors.  My colleague is correct, if you test positive - the Supervision will be violated and turn into a conviction.  The good news is that even if you did test (+) and violate the Supervision Order (other than assessing additional fines & entering a traffic conviction) the Court cannot sentence you to jail or any other harsh sentencing condition for the violation of a petty offense."
1811831,I agree with Bruce Truesdale's answer. Don't be so sure that your inherited IRA is at risk. That question in NJ is far from settled. You need to get independent legal advice from a qualified NJ bankruptcy lawyer about your best options.
1805711,Your mother needs to provide you with power of attorney.   You should consult with an attorney privately regarding this matter.   Good luck!
1812823,I can't tell from your question if you have a custody order already in place with visitation as agreed or otherwise nonspecific. If there is no custody order at all you need to file a petition to obtain custody and during the proceedings the court will establish a visitation schedule. Every weekend is unlikely but it's a factual determination based on the child's best interests. If there is a custody order in place with nonspecific visitation file a petition to modify and request that a specific schedule be implemented. I ugly recommend speaking with an attorney with respect to your options.
1810348,"You get one 9 mph over the limit speeding ticket every 3 years that does not affect your insurance points.  So, if you have no other moving violations in the past 3 year experience period then this ticket will not affect your insurance rates."
1798108,"I agree with the previous response. You will not be allowed to introduce statements from the children; however, a petition to modify the parenting plan can be filed if there is a detriment to the children.  In addition, did the other parent move outside of the school district? That may be cause to modify if there was no Notice of Intended Relocation. I recommend you consult with an attorney."
1796099,"Since it is a state agency things do get lost, and people do leave their position suddenly. Not having things in writing is a bad way to do business with CPS. If you can't get in touch with the individual you spoke with, you might need to talk to her supervisor and figure out what is going on. Also it is a good idea to always have a lawyer involved when CPS comes around, as unrepresented parties almost always get walked all over, such as what looks like has happened in this case. Best of luck"
1406480,"If you thought you did not understand the proceedings in court, then you definitely need to hire a lawyer to appeal."
1829626,"Although the defendant's plea was technically not guilty, he or she proceeded on the agreed statement of facts, which almost always results in a guilty finding. ABD probably means abandoned, and JA means judgment of acquittal. CP is the citation to the criminal procedure article, and the numbers refer to specific sections of it. Susp is short for suspended. P&P refers to Parole and Probation, now known as Community Supervision. Installment probably means that fines, restitution, and costs are to be paid in installments through parole and probation.   An experienced criminal defense attorney can help you evaluate the prosecution's case, any defenses that you might have, and any plea offer that might be made, so that you can decide whether to go to trial. Consider seeking a confidential consultation."
1810959,"He will  get credit  for every day he is  incarcerated. Parole for  felony DWI  is problematic, especially for  a three year sentence.  Letters from friends  and supporters couldn't hurt.  I would hire an attorney who has a majority of his work  in front of the parole board to achieve the best possible result."

2908625,"You should notify USCIS in Chicago too.  However if they do not cancel  your interview, you must be prepared to attend or you risk a denial."
1282813,Is it ok you bonded out? Yes. But that doesn't mean that you won't be called back into court to fight a bond revocation or increase in bond.  This doesn't help you case with the DUI especially if it was also drug related.  If you want to help your attorney help you...Then keep yourself out of trouble until your case is resolved.  The prosecutor loves it when people get new charges.  Don't give the prosecutor a reason to pay special attention to your case.
1812880,"The simple answer is no because you technically are not a business.  Many people rent single family homes, and even buy apartment buildings and rent them out and never get a business license.  Of course, there are IRS tax issues to consider when you rent your primary residence.  I hope that you have discussed these issues with your tax preparer before embarking on this."
1799689,"I urge you to speak with a family law attorney before taking any action.  One cannot predict the outcome of a case, however, given your son's age, it is unlikely that the Court is going to grant him a 50/50 timeshare at this time.  Your son is too young.  If you proceed now, I recommend that you propose day visits only until your son is older.  If you review the Court website (lasuperiorcourt.org) there is a proposed schedule based on the age of the child.  I recommend that you propose a schedule consistent with his age.  Further, you should not agree to a 50/50 when your son is 3 because you don't know if your son will be ready for such a schedule.  If you proceed now, you should also request child support."
1790867,"Technically you owe the providers what you owe. However, given the result, your lawyer may be able to negotiate your repayment with the providers. You should speak with your attorney about this issue right away. There may be other considerations as well, particularly if you are still treating. Again, your lawyer will be able to address your concerns. Good luck."
1789889,"I once had a case where the couple, who was still legally married , filed a joint petition and said that the marriage had failed and they were living separately but the wife (USC) was still willing to support the petition.  USICS did everything they could to change her mind but she held fast in her support.  USCIS responded by doing nothing on the I-751.  They wanted them to divorce.  Five years passed and the wife wanted to divorce so she could remarry.  The did this without an attorney till this point (things may have gone differently had they retained counsel) .  The I-751 was eventually approved but only after we threatened a mandamus action in federal court.  So, the point of the above is to tell you that you could have a very long and painful road.  It may make more sense to divorce if that is what you want and then just prove that it was a good faith marriage that ended in divorce.  Whatever you do, I strongly suggest that you seek the assistance of an experience immigration attorney to advise and assist you with the I-751 filing."
1824149,"More information is needed. Please consult with a medical malpractice lawyer near you. Your medical records must be reviewed by an expert who will look for evidence of substandard care with resultant injury. They will also have to make sure you haven't missed the deadline for suing. Depending on whether your injury is severe/permanent, the lawyer will either accept or reject your case. Medical malpractice cases are expensive, time-consuming and stressful; that's why very few are accepted. If yours ends up being rejected, there are other remedies. You can always complain to the medical board and hospital administrators."
1791694,"(1) Yes, you purchased a phone under the assumption that it worked, and it doesn't. Unless you were informed that this was an ""as is"" purchase, you should have recourse under a contract theory.   (2) Yes, if you are found in possession of stolen goods, and you know the goods to be stolen, you can be arrested, charged, and prosecuted for possession of stolen goods. The chances of this happening for a mobile phone, however, are very small. The best thing to do would be to seek a refund for the purchase. If this isn't possible, I would at least call the police and file an non-emergency report so they are at least aware that you believe you purchased a stolen mobile phone. This would help you in court if you ever were arrested, charged, and prosecuted for possession of stolen goods.   Good luck!"
1812051,"This is a HUGE problem and sadly you aren't the only person stuck in this gray area that appears to offer too few solutions .  There are very specific procedures about petitioning courts of civil and criminal enforcement agencies to suppress, clarify or even expunge this type of mistake or misdiagnosis, if one was made. While it's all pretty complicated, you should start by picking up a copy of any and all of your medical records you can get your hands on.   While it's unclear from your questions as to the source of misrepresentation or falsify, the source may likely may be as simple as statements made off the cuff every day between nurses and cops. This may or may not be a violation of state and federal health privacy protections. More details needed but my firm sees this kind if thing when patients pop up In ERs frequently.  To get your records: The state requires medical providers to accept the basic medical records release form. Even if a hospital tells you otherwise, take in or send in the state form for every custodian (doctor, hospital, etc.) who may have been the source of the innocent or misguided mistake.   If you see mistakes, seek out support or communication with a hospital or insurance co. ombudsman to see what changes can be made. A lawyer can help make contact on your behalf with police ombudsman as you will want to avoid independent communication that could result in you unintentionally revealing information that could be misconstrued or contrary to your best interests.

1805184,"""Charge off"" is a specific term in collections law and it is usually meant to mislead the debtor into thinking that the bank will not pursue the debt. It means nothing, really. How can you persuade the bank to record a zero balance? I do not think that you can, except to pay them a majority of what is owed."

1829003,"Not necessarily, the chemical test results may be unknown to the CHP if you provided a blood test.  In Solano County the results from a blood test are rarely known within a month of an arrest, if this was a breath case the CHP would have been aware of the result at the time of the arrest and would have recommended both the DUI and the .08 charges to the DA.  It is possible that you were below the legal limit, unfortunately, it doesn't prohibit the DA from moving forward with the driving under the influence charge.  It does help you in many respects, you should consider consulting a lawyer to discuss the facts of your case and possible defenses."
1500781,"That is a very complicated question. It depends on the type of evidence and its purpose. For example, a statement made by you at a later time about the incident would likely be admissible. Other evidence, like committing a similar crime 1.5 years later, would likely not be admissible. This is a public forum, so I would suggest having a one-on-one with your attorney. If you don't have one, then you should be looking for one."
1810424,"The date you filed on 7-8 stopped all legal proceedings. The landlord cannot obtain a future judgment against you assuming you complete your case and obtain a discharge. The landlords CAN obtain a judgment NOT for a monetary judgment but for a right to enter the property. But I advise my clients to give the landlord a letter with the keys indicating they are ABANDONING the property  if they want. Why? Because moving out is not enough, but abandonment is necessary for the landlord to regain possession. Proving abandonment  is hard as simply moving out is not enough as a tenant does not have the duty to live there, just pay for the right to. So a letter of abandonment makes it clear and then no further legal action is needed and thus no later judgment that might be misread. As a result of no judgment, he cannot garnish you either.   The above assumes you did NOT take action to intentionally damage the property in which case the landlord would have to file an adversary action against you in bankruptcy court! Good luck.

Now, it is important to note that you can continue to drive with your Sobriety Court restricted license indefinitely as long as you maintain the BAIID and drive within in the restrictions. In order to seek full reinstatement you will will need to file for a SOS appeal hearing. See the link: http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665-29353--,00.html. This is not a simple hearing based upon 18 years of practice before the SOS. Hearing officers have a great amount of control during these hearing and can intimidate people with hard or tricky questions. I would recommend contacting a qualified and experience drivers license appeal attorney such as myself.

2078743,"Ultimately, this analysis depends on what the terms of the lease itself state. Without having more information, the likelihood is that giving you a signed lease agreement constituted an offer to you by your landlord. Offers are open until, amongst other things, they are rescinded.  As you acknowledge having received the offer but not having signed it, and thus not accepted it, prior to now having been informed by your landlord that he had changed his mind, the most likely technical legal scenario is that the landlord has revoked and rescinded the offer, and the un-executed agreement that you have (and are considering signing) is no longer legally adequate to create an enforceable contract, regardless of whether or not you now sign it. Ultimately, then, the decision at this point as to whether there is to be a new contract is, practically speaking, with your landlord.  A contract is a meeting of the minds; if you know that the terms and/or fact of the contract is against the landlord's will, then it is not enforceable.  Should you wish to agree to all its terms as previously drafted, you may be able to sign and return the contract to your landlord as-is, and then ask that he acknowledge and agree to its terms and the acceptance thereof in writing.  In short, this is you proposing a new offer to him, with identical terms to the offer he proposed to you but then rescinded.   Of course, do also keep in mind that your landlord is under no obligation to accept your offer.   Ultimately, a more detailed understanding of the facts and the history of the parties is necessary before one may full advise you on how to best present such an offer moving forward, with the hopes that it would be agreeable and enforceable."

1819176,"If you make your child beneficiary of your will, the money will be held in a blocked account for the child until they reach 18 years old.  The money cannot be used for their care. [I have sat next to 16 year olds in court who could not wait for their blocked inheritance account to be distributed at 18 so they could buy the red sports car.] Then they receive the money to do with as they please.  A very bad idea.  Insurance policies have named beneficiaries and they will not pay to a minor child unless ordered to do so by the court.  Insurance policy with named beneficiaries are not subject to probate. The funds will be released at 18 to the minor. I suggest two approaches.  Have a lawyer prepare a trust and make the trust the beneficiary of your life insurance policy.  Your will and trust can nominate a guardian for your child till they reach 18 and can require payments for their care and well being before 18.  After 18, you can specify multiple payments over time until they reach an ""age of reason"" under the control of the trustee. The other approach is to create a will that creates a testamentary trust after your death but this may require court approval in probate.  The insurance policy would pay your estate as beneficiary. In either case your will can nominate a guardian for your child. I recommend you sit down with an estate planning attorney and discuss the option available to you.  This is not something to do yourself."
1806626,"Short answer is - likely no.   We would need to know a bit more information on the will and the wording.   If the will simply gives the house to the three children (regardless of who can stay as a minor child) then all three own the property, including the one who is currently living there.   All three parties have to pay for the care and upkeep of the home in equal shares. All three have the right to live there. All three can do what they wish with their shares.   Eviction is not the legal process you are looking for here.   A Partition Action is. If one of the owners of the home does not wish to sell his share (whether or not he lives is not really a factor) the others can sue for partition and force the sale of the home.   Partition is a legal maneuver that requires a skilled attorney to handle.  I strongly suggest that you seek the services of a skilled attorney who has already done several partitions. In Avvo's attorney search, type type the word partition and then pittsburgh as the location.   I wish you a successful resolution to this matter."

1806401,"I assume that you are asking about section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  That section is presently codified at 33 U.S.C. å¤ 1344.  Section 404 of the CWA establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands.  Activities in waters of the United States regulated under this program include fill for development, water resource projects (such as dams and levees), infrastructure development (such as highways and airports) and mining projects.  Section 404 requires a permit before dredged or fill material may be discharged into waters of the United States, unless the activity is exempt from Section 404 regulation (e.g. certain farming and forestry activities).  The permitting program is predicated on the premise that the CWA prohibits people from discharging dredged or fill material if a practicable alternative exists that is less damaging to the aquatic environment or if the nation‰Ûªs waters would be significantly degraded.  In other words, when someone applies for a permit, they must first show what steps they have taken to avoid impacts to wetlands, streams and other aquatic resources; that they have minimized the potential impacts; and that they will provide compensation for all unavoidable impacts that remain.  Even though the CWA uses the term ""waters of the United States"" in its definition of ""navigable waters (""The term ‰Û÷navigable waters‰Ûª means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas), the Act does not itself define the term ""waters of the United States.""  Instead, one must look to the Code of Federal Regulations for a definition:  The term waters of the United States means    (1) All waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide;    (2) All interstate waters including interstate wetlands;    (3) All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce including any such waters:    (i) Which are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recreational or other purposes; or    (ii) From which fish or shellfish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce; or    (iii) Which are used or could be used for industrial purpose by industries in interstate commerce;    (4) All impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters of the United States under the definition;    (5) Tributaries of waters identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section;    (6) The territorial seas;    (7) Wetlands adjacent to waters (other than waters that are themselves wetlands) identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.  During the 1970s and 1980s, this definition was upheld and found to cover  ""virtually all bodies of water"" in the country.  Int'l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 492 (1987).  Unfortunately (at least for people trying to find a firm definition), the Supreme Court has now ruled that this definition is too broad.  Rapanos v. United States, 126 S. Ct. 2208 (2006).  Even more unfortunately, in making that determination, the Court could not reach a majority opinion.  Instead, it issued five separate opinions that overlapped in part and conflicted in part.  Five of the nine justices agreed that the case should be sent back to the lower court for clarification of the facts, but they offered wildly divergent and contradictory rationales for the standard that the lower court should apply in determining what waters were subject to the CWA."

1793028,"Your landlord has a variety of options - and if you are on a month to month rental and been there less than one year, his smartest choice (assuming you are not currently behind on actual rent due) is to simply give you a 30 day No-Cause Termination of Tenancy Notice, which it sounds like he did.  He could have given you a 30 day For Cause Notice for failure to pay the late fee(s) but that would have allowed you to pay them within 14 days and continue living there - something he apparently no longer wants.  This way, he is assured he can get you out - if not within the 30 days on your own volition, then with a court's help.  If you are still there after the 30 days are up, he can (and likely will) go to the courthouse and file eviction paperwork.  You will be served a copy and must either get out or show up at court on the date/time specified in the paperwork you will be served.  If you continue to fight it and lose, or if you don't show up in court when/where you are supposed to, then the court will give the landlord a Judgment of Restitution, ordering you to get out.  If you still do not leave, then the landlord can have the Sheriff come out and physically remove you from the property.  If you come back without the landlord's permission, you will be subject to immediate arrest for trespassing.  Do understand that you will find it much harder to find a new place to rent if you make your existing landlord file in court to get rid of you and harder still if you make him go all the way through getting a Judgment of Restitution and/or having the Sheriff throw you out.  Potential new landlords will almost always do a check on such things prior to renting a new place to you and they normally refuse to rent to someone who did that to their last landlord.  Understand that the landlord will likely just deduct the late fee charges from your security deposit before returning whatever balance you have coming back or, if it is all used, he may still bill you for the late fees, even though you are out.  If you still do not pay them, if he thinks it is worth his effort, he can then sue you for the fees, presumably in small claims court.  All said and done, if you are late paying your rent 4 out of 5 months that you've been there and then fail to pay the late fees besides, you should not be surprised that the Landlord wants to throw you out.  Almost all landlords would and unless you change your behavior, you are likely to find it increasingly difficult to find a new landlord that is willing to rent to you and once that happens, it can take years to change that."

Exempted assets will remain exempt from attachment after the case, even as to a debt determined non dischargeable, (with minor exceptions, discussed below).  Bankruptcy Code å¤522(c) provides that unless your case was dismissed, all assets that were allowed as exempt during your case will remain exempt after the case, with only a few sensible exceptions. The debtor does not need to rely on non bankruptcy exemptions to protect such property.  This is a very obscure section of the Bankruptcy Code. In my 35 years of BK practice, I think I have had to invoke it only one time. It is understandably overlooked practitioners.  The excepted debts this does boil down to domestic support , debts secured by liens against the exempt assets, student loans that were obtained fraudulently, and persons who were insiders at banks and who committed embezzlement or theft of institutional assets resulting in a debt they owe to the FDIC, or to other Federal regulatory agencies, and any resulting entity."
1826204,"If a lawsuit seems likely, you should consult an attorney.  It's possible that the terms of your purchase agreement and/or the terms of the mortgage approval give you a way out of the purchase agreement.  However, assuming that's not the case, here are some principles of law that apply to this situation.  First, the seller is not going to be abe to get specific performance.  That works for a buyer of real estate because real estate is deemed to be unique.  However, the seller is getting money in exchange for the real estate, and that's not unique.  Instead, when the buyer breaches a purchase agreement for real property, the seller can sue for money damages, and the seller must mitigate damages.   That means the seller must make reasonable effort to find a new buyer, and then the damages are equal to the price the original buyer agreed to pay minus the price the new buyer agrees to pay.  And if the seller rejects a reasonable offer from another buyer, his damages will be limited to the difference between what the original buyer agreed to pay and what the other buyer offered to pay.  In addition, there may be some other incidental damages that accrue during the time the seller is looking for a new buyer.  Can you be forced to sell your house?  Well, that's an eventual possibility, but there are lots of other possibilities.  First, if the original buyer is sued and loses, all that matters is that the original buyer pay the damages owed.  It doesn't matter where the money comes from.  So, for example, if the orignal buyer doesn't have the cash, he or should could take out a second mortgage on the house to pay the damages.  Ultimately, if the damages aren't paid, it's possible for a judgment creditor to execute the judgment against assets owned by the debtor -- which could mean that the original seller could force a sale of the orginal buyer's house.  But it's a long way from where you are now to that point.  As I said, if it looks as if you are going to get sued, or if you are in fact sued, you should consult an attorney."

An experienced injury attorney will be able to review the facts and advise you on how to proceed with your claim.  Because these types of claims involve many complex issues, I would strongly discourage you from attempting to resolve this matter on your own. Insurance companies are only looking out for their own interests, not yours. They are likely to offer you a very quick, low dollar settlement and a promise to take care of your medical expenses to make this go away. That is not likely in your best interests, especially given the impact this is having on your employment.

Utah law presumes abandonment if the rent is more than 15 days late, the tenants' belongings are in the rental but there is no other reasonable evidence the tenants remain living there.  In this situation the Landlord is required to safeguard the tenants' personal property for at least 15 days, although tenants are liable for moving and storage costs.

1816153,"The city will probably not get involved in this situation as it is a civil matter.  You can have a surveyor come to your property and stake out the boundary line to determine if your fence encroaches onto the neighbors property.  These things usually come up when the neighbor decides to sell his land and the buyer does a survey which determines that the fence is in the wron place and he is possibly out of possession of a portion of his land.  Assuming thatyour fence does encroach onto your neighbors land, you could bring an action for adverse possession to try and obtain the land.  To do so you would have show open and notorious, continuous, and hostile possession and use of the land for a period of at least 10 years. Such a suit is diffucult to win and could be costly.  If your fence is encroaching onto the neighbors land you may be able to settle the dispute by entering into a boundary line agreement where you both agree that the fence is in the wrong place and you make no claim to ownership  of the land. That would effectively bar you claim to adverse possession of the land and allow the fence to remain in place.  On the other hand, if your fence does encroach onto your neighbors land he can bring an action to force you to move your fence."

1818912,"Courts typically require both sides of the case to meet and confer regarding their respective pretrial documents, including pretrial motions, jury instructions, witness lists and exhibit lists.  Many courts require the parties to file jointly.  Check your court's local rules and contact the clerk of your department to determine your judge's particular requirements.  Whatever your courtroom's procedure is, each of your exhibits will be assigned its own number.  That number will be used for the duration of the trial, regardless of how you organize, introduce and present your exhibits.  You will need multiple copies of each, so that you, the judge, opposing counsel and any witnesses may view them during trial.  If you have your own internal way of organizing your exhibits for ease of use and reference during trial, all the better.  But just know that each one of your exhibits will have its own number."

1788611,"In Prince George's County, you have two options: (1) trial, to try and prove you're not guilty of intending to steal the items you were stopped with after passing the sensors; or (2) have your lawyer cut a deal with the prosecutor to perform some hours of community service in exchange for the charges being dropped and without having to admit that you did anything wrong.  I do not include the third option of pleading guilty, because for a first offense, it should be unnecessary.  Getting the charges dismissed without cutting a deal would depend on the State's case and witness availability, and usually means you're proceeding to trial and are rejecting a community service deal. no matter what, you should avoid a conviction and will be able to have the charges expunged (erased) from your record.  Only the community service option, once arranged, offers a guaranty that you will be able to do that at the earliest time.  Going to trial risks conviction, and even if the judge grants you a ""PBJ"" disposition (which strikes the conviction), you would have to wait three years to get the charge expunged.  In order to be eligible for immediate expungement going the trial route, you'd have to be found not guilty.  Get a free consultation with a lawyer familiar with PG County and explore the strength of your defense as well as the best decision as to how to handle these charges.  You do not want a criminal record for life, as that will make finding a job much more difficult."

1795642,"A prosecutor cannot ethically put a criminal defendant in jeopardy of conviction based on testimony that the prosecutor knows is false.  That is called suborning perjury and carries very severe consequences for the prosecutor's life and career.  The cases where that happens are very rare.  Knowing this should answer the question you pose.  A prosecutor must reasonably believe that a witness' testimony is truthful to put them on the stand and a jury must later be able to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were knowingly false in order to successfully prosecute a perjury charge.  It would be (and is) a rare case where the prosecutor has reason to believe the witness will testify truthfully when they call them to the stand and then obtains strong evidence that they knowingly lied after they present their testimony.  It occasionally happens that someone will actually lie in Court about something that can be easily and clearly established and in some of those cases the District Attorney will pursue criminal charges.  In most cases, however, things are not that clear and it is up to the defense attorney to point out the weaknesses in the testimony and expose questions about the witnesses' credibility.  It would be nice if everyone who intentionally lied could be put in jail, but safeguards are needed to avoid prosecution of people who honestly remember or see things differently.  The inability to establish what is in a person's mind beyond a reasonable doubt raises practical problems to most perjury prosecutions."

The opposing party will have to appear before the Court and justify, if she can, why she is in violation of the Order and why such relief should not be granted to you.

1803787,"Basically, you need a Montana attorney to clear this up for you in Montana, or it will never go away. If Montana is alleging the person being held in custody had fled Montana to avoid prosecution, then there will be an initial hearing in Minnesota within a week or less of being arrested. At that hearing, the defendant can either waive extradition, meaning he or she agrees to be taken to Montana, or can fight extradition. If the defendant fights extradition, then bail will be set and the defendant will be allowed to remain in Minnesota. The bail usually only is good for the county the person was arrested in, however, and if the defendant goes to another county he or she may be arrested again because the Montana warrant will remain outstanding and open until the defendant sorts it out in Montana.  If the defendant is fighting extradition, then there will be a review hearing set for 30 days later, and if Montana has not dropped the warrant or the defendant has not voluntarily traveled to Montana and sorted it out by that time, another review hearing will be set for 30 days after that. At any time, Montana can get a governor's warrant to insist that Minnesota immediately send the defendant to Montana, but that is something they don't do in a lot of cases. If Montana doesn't get a governor's warrant by the time 90 days is up, then the defendant is free to go in Minnesota and the extradition is dropped. That does not mean the warrant is gone, however, and it could still be used to arrest the defendant in another state.  These answers are general information about the law and they are not legal advice about how to handle a specific case, since we don't have all the facts of your situation. You need to contact one of the Minnesota attorneys directly in order to get help with your actual situation.

If you are willing to buy it for $100.00, for instance, you would owe him $100.00 for the purchase and $500.00 for the replacement after mitigation, meaning you would pay the same amount anyway so he might as well give you the table.

I note you put as topics, criminal, criminal charges, criminal defense and felony.  I am sure a judge is such a matter would be happy to be friends with someone involved with such a case.  The defendant is probably an innocent person and the victims and witnesses usually have NO connection at all to any of the situation and have NEVER done anything to place themselves in a bad position, and generally everyone in these cases are usually responsible, law-abiding people with great judgment, who get into these situations through no fault of their own.

It is not impossible for one to create, in what would be a retroactively-legal fashion, mashup-style apparel using variations of protected characters in the absence of a proper license; however, such combinations need to be providing some sort of commentary or critical angle and should be carefully evaluated by an attorney.

The stalker will get to file the first brief, which is technically due 70 days after the notice of appeal.  However, that deadline usually is extended by the fact that the clerk of court and court reporter need more time to complete the transcript of the hearing and the index to the record, which shows the 5th District what happened at the trial court level.  Once the record is finished, the stalker will have 20 days to file a brief.  Then your wife will have 25 days to file an answer brief (which can be extended if necessary), and the stalker will get the chance to file the last written submission, called the reply brief.

Although the name of the ALJ is no longer withheld, that does not mean that your case cannot be reassigned for other reasons, even after you have already received notice with an ALJ name listed on it.  You are also correct in that the Social Security Office of Disability Adjudication and Review is required to provide you with at least 20 days notice of your scheduled hearing date. However, you can voluntarily waive this 20 day notice. Most hearing office actually try to schedule hearings 2-3 months out, and normally only schedule unrepresented individuals with less than 30 days notice.

The reason this process can be difficult is because you need somebody who will view YOUR circumstances and ensure the final paperwork meets the requirements of YOUR divorce. In this situation, you now need to either: a) start over; or b) find somebody who will review all the documentation and make the necessary adjustments/corrections. Option B may actually be more costly. Most lawyers in your area would not charge for a consultation so I would recommend asking around. Good luck."

1782058,"The following is from a Bench and Bar article by Hon. Luise Dovre Bjorkman and David F. Herr, which discusses the ""new rule.""  http://mnbenchbar.com/2013/06/reducing_cost_delay/   Rule 5.04 is amended to require that any case be filed with the court within one year after its commencement against any party, unless the parties stipulate to extend the filing period.  This rule does not change the rule for commencement of actions‰ÛÓcommencement is still accomplished by service and filing is not required at that time.  But within a year after commencement, the action must be filed or it will be deemed dismissed.  Dismissal under the rule is with prejudice.  The goal of this rule is not to create more dismissals of actions, but to require that they be filed and placed under court management and scheduling within the first year.  Dismissal with prejudice occurs by operation of the rule‰ÛÓthe court doesn‰Ûªt act on it and nothing has to be filed to obtain the dismissal.  Passage of a year from commencement against the first party without filing would create a dismissal; it would essentially create an ""estoppel by rule,"" much like the mandatory counterclaim provision of Minn. R. Civ. P. 13.  If a subsequent attempt were made to litigate the issue, either in another action or by the belated filing of the original action, the rule would create a bar to the assertion of the claims in the prior case.  The rule does not discuss whether relief from the dismissal would be available, but Rule 60 might be available to allow relief from the dismissal if the criteria of Rule 60 could be met.  The most likely basis under Rule 60 would be ""excusable neglect,"" and the parties seeking to proceed with the case would need to establish both neglect (relatively easy to do) and excuse (perhaps not as easily established).  Counsel should not rely on this life-ring, however‰ÛÓRule 60 allows for relief from an ""order or judgment,"" neither of which would arguably exist for a dismissal by operation of Rule 5.04.  Counsel should understand that the rule provides for dismissal of the action, not merely the complaint.  This likely means that counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims would all be dismissed.  And all that will be necessary to prevent that is for any party to file any pleading with the court, so it should not be at all Draconian."
1818782,"According to the IRS, In determining whether the person providing service is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and independence must be considered.  Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories: 1.Behavioral: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job? 2.Financial: Are the business aspects of the worker‰Ûªs job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.) 3.Type of Relationship: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business? Under Colorado Law, 9 guidelines are established. If the worker is an independent contractor, then the employer must not:   1.  require the individual to work exclusively for the person for whom the services are performed; 2.  establish a standard for the individual; 3.  pay the individual a salary or an hourly rate instead of a fixed or contract rate; 4.  terminate the work of the service provider during the contract period unless the service provider violates terms of the contract; 5.  provide more than minimal training for the individual; 6.  provide tools or benefits to the individual, except that materials and equipment may be supplied; 7.  dictate the time of performance, except that a completion schedule may be established; 8.  pay the service provider personally instead of making checks payable to a trade or business name of the provider; and 9.  combine the business operations of a person for whom service is provided in any way with the business operations of the service provider instead of maintaining all such operations separately and distinctly Depending on all the facts of your situation, your employer may indeed owe you back taxes and you should see an employment attorney in your area as soon as possible for a closer analysis.  As for benefits, that is less clear, but you very well might be.  The United States Department of Labor is actively pursuing companies who violate labor laws by misclassifying employees as independent contractors:  http://www.dol.gov/whd/media/press/whdpressVB3.asp?pressdoc=Southeast/20130509.xml  You may also be entitled to back wages for unpaid overtime.

1355518,"There is not a case holding that the responsible party pay for a replacement car that is better than the car that was totaled.  Rather, the defendant is responsible for paying you the 'Actual Cash Value' of your car at the time of the accident (taking into consideration many factors such as age, condition, etc.)  Moreover, the at-fault party is possible under insured for the property damage portion of this accident making you ability to settle with the insurance company significantly more difficult.  This is where having collision insurance would help you.  Your insurance would pay your damage now and they would have to try to collect against the at-fault party.  But, you write that you have liability only.  As a result, if the at-fault drive has insufficient property loss coverage (such as the state minimum of $5,000), then your approach should be different.  You should consult with an attorney as to how and why filing a small claims action for your property damage at this time may be your best bet even if your car was worth more than $10k.

Just to be clear, is there a foreclosure sale scheduled? If so, you will need to file an emergency motion to cancel sale immediately. I agree with my colleague and will suggest you retain an attorney to help you . In addition, since you submitted documentation recently, the new CFPB Regulation-Z prohibits foreclosure while the modification documents are pending. It's imperative that you or the atty include this point in your motion to cancel sale OR abate the proceedings (if the foreclosure sale has not been set) and attach a copy of the pertinent section of Regulation-Z to the motion. Hopefully this will help you and will force the bank to get their act together and review the documentation so they can provide you response to your modification efforts without moving forward with the foreclosure proceedings.  As mentioned by my colleague, if by chance this does not work, then a Chp 13 will stay the proceedings  (Automatic Stay) where you can workout a Chp 13 modification. Best of luck and hope it works out for you."
1818317,"I'm glad to hear that she's at least gotten out of that situation. When analyzing the potential success of a VAWA-based petition, it's really important to have all of the factual details about the situation. A lot will depend on the severity and nature of the abuse she suffered, as well as information about her relationship and spouse (such as his citizenship/immigration status and whether the marriage was entered into in good faith versus for immigration purposes). If her abuser was a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, the fact that she's taken out a restraining order and involved the police could suggest that she's got a strong case, but she should seriously consider speaking to an immigration attorney to get a full sense of her case and what to expect moving forward. These can be difficult situations to talk about for someone who has suffered abuse, but it is important to make sure she knows what her options are, and what she needs to do to to maintain the best chance for success in her case."

1822514,"Unless it was specifically provided for in the court order, your kid's Mom is probably not required to provide clothes for their vacation. Courts will modify custody and visitation orders but only if there is a ""substantial change of circumstance,"" and if the modification is ""in the best interest of the child/children."" Courts do not typically like to spend time on this kind of minutia.  My practical advice to you is to not send the clothes you buy to Mom's house, but instead keep them so that you are prepared for these types of situations. The less bickering between you and Mom, the better it is for your children. I believe children are more often than not to be aware of these kinds of issues and the more you and Mom can get along, the less stress will be imposed upon them.  If Mom is that vindictive there is nothing you can say to get her to cooperate. Stop trying, and instead do what you can personally to make your kid's life better."
1798831,"Not without nolle prossing the charge and having the charge reissued, which I have never seen happen with a reckless driving ticket so there's no need to worry about that.  For the most part, the charge is what it is.  Many officers will cut drivers with a good record a break by writing what could be reckless by speed (i.e. 20 mph+ over the limit) as general speeding tickets.  The advantage is that you avoid a potential misdemeanor.  The disadvantage is that you'll still get 6 demerit points from the VA DMV.  You may still be eligible for a reduction at court, so don't dismiss the idea of hiring an attorney if you don't want 6 points.  Good luck!"

You will need to submit the affidavit of support after the FORM I-130 is approved and is transferred to the National Visa Center. You will not need to submit the affidavit of support to the National  Visa Center for quite a period of time in the future. (2) It is very possible and unfortunate that visas in the category for US citizens sponsoring  siblings could take 12 years or more. The reality is that the children of your sibling may not be eligible to receive visas  as derivatives of their parent.  (3)  The fact that your sister is ill will not expedite the process.

1789666,"No, No, and No in order.    Since your mortgage was discharged and not re-affirmed it is illegal for the creditor to attempt to collect the debt through the credit reporting system.  All you need to do if that is the case is dispute the report to the credit reporting agency and they should remove it.  However, this may not be what happened in your case because your new lender would have attempted to contact the old lender directly to get a payment history and that is what could have caused the problem, not necessarily the credit report.  You have no legal contract to pay the mortgage personally, but if the loan is not paid according to the contract the home can be foreclosed on.  IF you pay off the loan, they will issue a re-conveyance of the deed of trust .  It has no affect on the title or the deed that you have, just the lien created by the deed of trust."

1816118,"Subpoenaing the officer used to be common practice and a good strategy in itself.  In many courts this is no longer the case.  Many agencies now direct their officers to show up and prosecutors are becoming more diligent in securing the officer's presence.  In addition, subpoenaing the officer often just gives he or she the opportunity to show up and fill in the missing information on the ticket with live testimony.  In my opinion, you should only subpoena the officer if you have a reason.  If you are challenging the law ""as applied"" it could backfire as the officer could testify to additional facts not in his report.  On the other hand, if you are challenging the law on the grounds of vagueness, there is probably nothing the officer can testify to that will change anything.  In general, most judges in this area are not going to hold subpoenaing the officer against you. The bigger question is ""does the officer have more potential to help or hurt you if he or she appears?""  Since I don't know the facts of your case I cannot answer that for you."

1661469,"I have great news for you!  I am an immigration attorney.  Sounds like you need me :)  In this instance, there are a couple of considerations.  You should expect to be placed in removal proceedings.  It does not sound like you will be charged with an aggravated felony.  First, this does not appear to be a crime of violence, and secondly, as you described it, it sounds like you received straight probation.  As such, under sec. 1101(a)(48)(b), this probably wouldn't be an aggravated felony anyway (called ""agg-fel"" in our parlance).  Now, if this is NOT an aggravated felony, you might qualify for various types of relief when put into removal proceedings.  Most importantly, however, you are not <i>disqualified</i> from bond.  That's really important -- as nothing is a morale crusher like sitting in the pokie for six months waiting for your immigration court individual calendar hearing (fancy term for trial on the merits).  Various places in the country have differing bond amounts (i.e. each immigration court is different).  However, for a typical offense of theft, you can probably count on at least a $7500 bond.  Only an immigration judge can take away your LPR status -- so while CBP (custom and border patrol) may hold your card, the judge alone will make the final determination.  What to expect at that 23 April meeting:  Well -- a lot of sitting around.  These things are reminiscent of a bad 'B' grade horror movie.  Dark waiting lobby, lots of unhappy people, most of them confused, a person walking around calling for the next individual to ""come back.""  You will be asked about your status, and you will be told that you are deport-able.  Most likely you will get an NTA at that point (Notice to Appear -- that's the summons paper to immigration court).  Occasionally, ICE will come take you from the airport.  If that happens, you will held until either bond is set (ICE can do that) or you are seen by an immigration judge -- usually within 10 days.  Give us a call if you would like to discuss this further -- but absolutely do it before the 23rd.  We have extensive experience representing folks in removal proceedings and we can do a lot to put your mind at ease.  Although you may wish to voluntarily depart, doing so is a death sentence to your LPR (legal permanent residency) status.  That should be an option of last resort tied to post-hearing voluntary departure.  You may have excellent equities arguing for your remaining in the US.  You can reach us at 703-402-2723.

You will also want to remember that other deductions including mortgage interest and property taxes can change the amount of support, as well as mandatory union dues, unreimbursed business expenses, hardship deductions, etc.  You may want to consult with a local family law attorney to run your support scenarios for you.  They can give you a more comprehensive analysis and possibly reveal more deductions that help you get the optimal amount of support in your case.  Hope this helps a little."

Don‰Ûªt assume the attorney is being completely honest about their experience and capabilities.  Check them out.  Beware of law firms who operate their companies like ""mills"".  Make sure to talk to the attorney you will be working with, not a staff person.  When interviewing the attorney ask them how long they have practiced bankruptcy law.  Ask what percentage of their practice is focused on consumer work.  Ask whether they are experienced in both chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases.  Ask the attorney for references.  Ask about their policy of returning phone calls.  They should be committed to answering specific questions about your situation and help you understand your options.  If, after talking with them you are still confused about the issues you raised, find another attorney.  Check them out with the various ranking sources: such as www.AVVO.com, and the State Bar.  An attorney is should be your guide through this process.  They should educate you, be there to assist you in how to avoid pitfalls and help you plan for your future after bankruptcy.

2137138,"I'm sorry your father has had to go through this. It sounds like an ugly situation.  First, it is not necessarily illegal for an employer to require an employee to work 7 days in a row or 20 hours straight through. However, employers must pay overtime for all work over 8 hours in one day, or over 40 hours in one week. Also, employers must pay overtime for the first 8 hours worked on the 7th consecutive day of work. This is pursuant to California Labor Code section 510(a) which states:   510.  (a) Eight hours of labor constitutes a day's work. Any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee. Any work in excess of 12 hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the regular rate of pay for an employee. In addition, any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the regular rate of pay of an employee. Nothing in this section requires an employer to combine more than one rate of overtime compensation in order to calculate the amount to be paid to an employee for any hour of overtime work.   There are some exceptions to Labor Code section 510 but they do not appear to apply to your father's situation.  If the employer did not pay your father overtime as required, then your father most likely has a valid wage and hour claim.  Further, if your father is owed any money for overtime, then he is also owed money for waiting time penalties:  California law requires employers to pay an employee's final wages at the time the employer ends the employment, or within 72 hours if the employee resigns without giving 72 hours notice.  ""Final wages"" consist of regular pay, overtime pay, accrued and unused vacation pay, PTO, commissions that can be calculated, some bonuses and perhaps other components.  It does not include unused sick leave.  If the employer does not pay as required, there is a penalty against the employer and in favor of the employee: the employee‰Ûªs pay continues as if the employee were still working, every day until the employer pays in full, up to a maximum of 30 days. The employee is entitled to interest at 10 per cent per annum on the unpaid amount. Also, if the employee must go to court to get his or her pay, then the employee is awarded reasonable attorney‰Ûªs fees and costs of suit.  You asked if it is legal for an employer to cut an employee's hours. Yes, it is, unless the REASON the employer cut the hours is based on illegal discrimination. For example, if the employer cut your father's hours because of his age, and your father is at least 40 years old, then it would be illegal age discrimination to cut hours. The comments about your father being ""too old"" could be evidence of illegal discrimination.  I suggest your father speak with one or more experienced employment law attorneys with whom he can discuss the details of his situation.

1795442,"If your landlord wanted you to move out, he needed to provide you with a written notice terminating the tenancy. If you've lived there under one year, it needs to be a 30 day notice. If you've been there over a year, it needs to be a 60 day notice. In the City of San Diego, if a tenant has been living there for more than 2 years, the landlord cannot terminate the tenancy except for very specific, stated reasons. (However, this does not apply to lodger situations as you appear to be in.) If you and the landlord mutually agreed to terminate the tenancy, then the landlord has no right to unilaterally insist upon an earlier move-out date.  Landlords have 21 days after the tenant moves out to provide either: a) The entirety of the deposit back; or b) Less than the whole of the deposit back and an itemized statement and receipts for repairs.  If the Landlord in your situation does not do either of these, Small Claims Court would likely be an excellent venue for you.   Below I've included a link to the Landlord/Tenant Handbook put out by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. It contains a great deal of useful information."

1819660,"You are doing the right thing by keeping records of your attempts to make the child available for parenting time.  There are two ways that a parent can ask the court for help with parenting time: first, the  parent can file a motion to enforce parenting time. This would require the other party to present evidence that you are not in compliance with the divorce decree.  Second, the parent can file a motion for contempt.  This would require the other party to prove by clear and convincing evidence that you willfully disobeying a court order.  Either way, if your ex files something in the court, he will have to prove that YOU are in violation of the court order.  However, the courts usually HATE micromanaging family matters.  If you two can find a way to work this out, do that.  Hire a private mediator if you need to. It's cheaper than hiring two lawyers and easier on the family as a whole."

1787147,"Child Custody and Child Support are two separate issues for the Court to decide.  A parent nor the Court can prevent another parent from having access to his or her child purely because said parent is not financially supporting their child.    However, with that being said, because there is a current child support action filed against you, the Court does have the discretion to require you to pay child support retroactive from the date your child's mother filed for child support.  I would recommend making some payments to the mother (or showing proof (i.e. receipts, credit card statements, etc.) of what expenses you have paid for your child while he is in your care), otherwise it is possible that you can be hit with a large amount of arrears owed on top  of the regular monthly child support (depending on several factors, including but not limited to, the custody arrangement that is ordered and both yours and the child's mother income).    As for your income, if you are earning income, no matter how it is earned (i.e. it does not have to be earned from a day job), and you reported 0 on your financial statement, that can go against your creditability and the court can impute income to you, as well as places sanctions against you to include ordering you to pay attorney fees to your child's mothers.  I would recommend, at a minimum, to amended your financial statement to have the correct income you are receiving. This may allow you to save face when your case is heard in Court."

1808021,"If your upper extremity pain, shoulder pain and neck pain are caused by repetitive keyboard work, you may have a viable claim for a repetitive stress injury under the Pennsylvania WC Act. First, print out the emails that you sent to your supervisor and HR. Save them. You may need them later.   Second, look in the lunch room or other common areas in your place of employment. Does you employer post employment law poster somewhere? Look for a poster about your WC rights. Does your employer have a panel of WC doctors? If so, you need to go see one of them for 90 days. If not, you are free to go to a doctor of your own choosing. A workers compensation lawyer can help you by recommending several doctors in the specialty you need to evaluate your condition.   Once you get a medical opinion that your condition is work related, send it to your supervisor and HR. Again, save the email. Ask for the contact information for the workers compensation insurance company. If it is not provided, a workers compensation lawyer can look that information up on line for you.  Your employer must promptly report your claim to its workers compensation carrier once you give adequate notice. Talk to a workers compensation lawyer to determine if your prior emails were sufficient to create this obligation. Once reported the carrier has 21 days to accept or deny the claim.  These types of claims are usually contested, so I highly recommend you call a workers compensation lawyer as soon as you can. The lawyer will guide you through the process step by step. The lawyer gets a percentage of what you recover, so there is no fee if there is no case. The only time there is a fee is if you win. All the advice you get before then is free.   If no doctor will say your problem is caused by work, your employer still has an obligation to accommodate you under the American's with Disabilities Act. You may also have medical leave rights under the Family Medical Leave Act. Talk to a workers compensation lawyer first and that lawyer will guide you to other lawyers, if needed, to address those issues."
1792602,"If you have a consumer protection claim, you can get treble damages plus actual attorney fees.  Assuming that the defendant has the means, either by personal resources or by insurance, an attorney could reasonably expect to get paid.

1803269,"The key underlying trademark law concept for you to understand is that in the United States tidemark rights are fundamentally founded upon the concept of use.  If a particular company has a priority of use and that use, over time, ahs been consistent and appropriate, then that company will, generally speaking, have enforceable trademark rights against anyone who comes along later and uses the same or similar trademark.  Although you have not provided details, there might be an argument that would allow multiple companies to use a similar (or even same) trademark if there is little or no risk of confusing the two marks.  After all, trademark law is intended to protect CONSUMERS, not companies.  It seems a more prudent course would be to use a different trademark for your won goods and services to avoid future headaches."
1817062,"If you have proof, the first thing you need to do is to stop the bleeding.  The Court rules and the Estate and Protected Individuals Code simplify the means for an interested by which you can do that.  Under the relevant court rule, ""the court may appoint a special fiduciary or enjoin a person subject to the court's jurisdiction under MCL 700.1309 on its own initiative, on the notice it directs, or without notice in its discretion.""  MCL 700.1309, in pertinent part, provides as follows: ""Upon reliable information received from an interested person, county or state official, or other informed source, including the court's files, the court may enter an order in a proceeding to do either or both of the following: (a) Appoint a special fiduciary to perform specified duties. (b) Enjoin a person subject to the court's jurisdiction from conduct that presents an immediate risk of waste, unnecessary dissipation of an estate's or trust's property, or jeopardy to an interested person's interest."" So if you are an interest person, you can provide the court with reliable information, the court has the power to immediately appoint a special fiduciary and to order your cousin to not do anything that will dissipate the estate's assets.  If this is a real concern of yours, you should move on this quickly.  Good luck."

1810695,"This question requires more characters to answer than I think are allotted.  Your question touches upon principles of stare decisis that are the subject of entire classes in law school.  Put simply, California appeals courts are broken up into geographical areas.  Decisions of the court of appeal are binding upon California superior courts but not upon other California appeals panels/courts.  Where you see a rejection (as in the Yvanova case) it is another appeals court making its independent (and valid) decision.  The legal basis for a lower court to not follow an appellate court opinion usually has to do with the specifics of a case.  For instance, the Glaski case allowed the Plaintiff's complaint to go forward and has some helpful language to others who would sue a bank and MERS regarding either one's ability to foreclose.  Where that can fail (and where the superior courts are finding their bases for not following the appellate court) is in the specifics of any new case.  In the Yvanova case, for instance, the court determined that the Plaintiff did not have standing to challenge the assignment and therefore could not make the argument made in Glaski (if the Plaintiff had standing, then presumably the court would have followed Glaski).  In other cases the superior court uses as its basis for declining to follow Glaski that the Plaintiff has admittedly failed to pay the mortgage and therefore any deficiencies in assignment does not negate that factual base - that foreclosure was proper because the Plaintiff did not satisfy the terms of the mortgage agreement.  The bottom line is that one appeals court in California can differ from/disagree with another appeals court (until the California Supreme Court weighs in and provides binding precedent for all) and superior courts can usually find a factual basis to differentiate their decisions from binding precedent if they don't agree with the appellate court decision."

Either way, you can and should proceed to evict them though you are likely to need the help of a good local landlord-tenant attorney.  Otherwise, you are likely to lose and possibly end up owing them, plus still having them there.  Do understand that the landlord can also evict them, and you too, if you have violated the terms of your lease in any way which, as noted, is highly likely.

1802773,"There is a difference between granting you custody and determining paternity. The latter is more difficult. The child and you are in Texas. There is not any question that you are the child's mother. With or without the father's presence, the court may award custody.   The paternity issue is more difficult. Certainly if the putative father submits himself to personal jurisdiction in Texas by submitting to a blood test or signing an acknoledgement of paternity, the Texas court can determine paternity. That finding would be binding in New York under the Full Faith and Credit provision of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, a default would not advance your cause. Before awarding child support, the New York court would have to examine the extent of the Texas personal jurisdiction. A default in Texas is not going to support a finding of personal jurisdiction. Under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, you could try to rely on the Texas finding of paternity and an award of child support, but it would be very difficult.   Were you to have a default in Texas, nothing would stop you from going to New York, via counsel there, to establish paternity and obtain child support. You would have to go there for trial. But, its possible that the court might order, if the other side did not consent, that your pre trial deposition be taken in Texas while you remain there, caring for your child. At least, the court might order the other side to pay your expenses of traveling to New York. There are companies that specialize in setting up video and audio depositions. Once a blood test is ordered and positive results are in, it's really down to a question of how much child support should be ordered. Good luck with this"

The 1993 conviction will be off CCAP anytime now (20 years).  The felony is on for 50 years (30 more to go).  Without the DA's cooperation I don't believe anything short of the governor's intervention will work.  Read the statute.

1733326,"When you sign the bankruptcy petition, you are certify that the information is true and accurate to the best of your knowledge.  At your 341 hearing, debtor's are usually asked by the trustee if there are any changes or amendments that you failed to disclose.  With that being said, if you paid your attorney to amend the schedules to disclose the insurance claim, and he did not do it, there may be a cause of action against your attorney.  However, even when disclosed, the insurance proceeds are property of the bankruptcy estate and would need the approval of the Trustee to use the cash the cash collateral to repair your house.  When you say  the proceeds were stolen, what does that mean?  That part of your question is confusing.  But if the money was there or owed prior to filing, the trustee is still involved with the distribution of the funds."

1821326,"Well,  the PLF is not the final arbiter.  First, the PLF will review the issues and make a determination about the errors made.  Remember that the standard is that the attorney acted with the same average care and expertise as any lawyer practicing in that area - not that he is perfect or right all of the time.  But if the PLF said that there was no ""malpractice"" you can still sue the attorney for malpractice if you can find an attorney to take the case.    Its difficult to find someone to bring this kind of case but there are folks out there.  Its not that lawyers don't sue other lawyers, its that the standard is average level of competency sand the issues in your divorce are subjective (different people might see them in different ways)  so unless there was a dramatic wrong (like not showing up for court at all)  it will be difficult to find someone.     As to your specific issue regarding attorney fees, consider this.  In order for your ex wife to get an award of attorney fees, she has to ask the court for it and provide support for what her attorney did.  So if you figure that her attorney only charged $200/hour - which is low end of divorce work- then her attorney put in 20 hours of work.  That's way more time than just showing up and having a hearing - so its unlikely that the judge awarded the fees for any reason other than that is the time  her attorney put into the case.  He would more likely award attorney fees where he thinks that it took the (in your case) wife going to court to get an award of spousal support, child support, or a division of property.    so in assessing the case, i tend to agree with the PLF but to answer your specific question, the only way to  appeal is to find someone to sue the attorney on your behalf."
1801657,"When there are multiple claimants against one deft, his ins co usually wont settle out claims piecemeal. They will try to settle all at once.

Each new Petition will strictly be adjudicated based on its own merits, and if judged incomplete, doubtful or too vague or generic the petitioner will be issued a ""Request For Further Evidence"" (""RFE""), a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) or a flat out denial, even though the latter is rare immediately upon filing.

1822714,"If he touched or groped you, you may have a civil and criminal cl;aim against him for assault.  However, you would need to speak to an attorney and find out what laws and remedies you have in your state. Without more information it is not possible to give an opinion about this. The best advice would be to set an appointment with an attorney who specializes in employment law and sexual harassment cases. Then after a thorough review of all of the facts, they can give you an opinion as to whether you have a viable claim, and what procedural steps you should take.  Many attorneys handle these cases on a contingency percentage fee, taking a percentage of the recovery. In contingency fee arrangements, there are no hourly fees.  In some states attorneys do not charge anything for an initial appointment to discuss your case but in others there is a reasonable fee charged to compensate the attorney for their time and advice.  I would suggest that you begin your search for an attorney on this Avvo website.  There is a tab ""Find A Lawyer"" on the home page of Avvo at www.avvo.com that will help you find a lawyer in this practice area in your locale. Good luck!"

Then, you should consult legal counsel.    That said, the general rule is that only a contracting party is liable for the contract.  Thus if you are not personally part of the contract you would not be immediately liable for the debt.  However, if you fail to follow proper wind up procedure you could become liable for the debt under theories such as piercing the veil, or fraudulent transfer.  To that end, while it is apparently a difficult economic circumstance, it could get far worse should you fail to follow the law governing such events.  Best of luck."

Often collection attorneys will cooperate in working out a payment plan because they understand that it benefits them in the long run to be reasonable instead of pushing you into bankruptcy.  I would hire counsel to investigate any possible challenges to the judgment, garnishment and to engage in negotiations with the creditor."

You may want to contact the public defender for the county where your case is pending to see if their office can process an application for their service before your first court appearance.

It may not be a significant reduction if anything, so you should consider whether it would be worth it. Consult with a family lawyer. Good luck."

1814015,"Due to prior convictions for drug offenses, even a personal possession case of marijuana against you could be charged as a felony, thus this could become a felony charge if the mushrooms test positive for a controlled substance.  Psilocybin and Psilocin are not commonly tested for substances, so it may take the state crime lab months to complete an analysis of the substance.  It could have been charged earlier if you'd told the officer you believed them to be psilocin/psilocybin containing mushrooms or if the officer had conducted an initial Ehrlich's reagent test for indole alkaloids.    My guess is that the officer intended to write out a warning ticket, ran your license and discovered your prior offenses.  This is an issue you will deal with for the remainder of your life as every law enforcement check is going to turn up drug convictions and likely lead to officers doing what they can to search your vehicle.   There may ultimately be a way to contest the K9 search if the officer unreasonably detained you longer than necessary to write a ticket without reasonable suspicion to believe that there would be any drugs in the vehicle.    In addition, I've never heard of a dog being trained to detect mushrooms as they are relatively uncommon as far as the drug trade goes.  Though a K9 may detect marijuana odors long after there has been marijuana in a vehicle.  It may be possible, with an in depth records review, to challenge the reliability of the dog and thereby challenge the officer's probable cause to search the vehicle if you did not consent to the search.    Be sure to speak confidentially with an attorney rather than posting any further details in public."
1821961,"Judges differ in their settlement conference practices. The basic format, however, is for the sides to explain their views of the case and how they intend to prove any disputed facts. Typically, a judge will ask for a letter from each side spelling out that party's view of the case  (with a copy of any key documents). The letter is submitted before the conference and helps the judge become familiar with the case. If you have questions about what you need to submit before the conference, I would just call the judge's chambers and speak with an assistant. They are usually very helpful.   During the actual conference, most settlement judges will give an indication of their opinion about how the case will turn out. That ""opinion,"" however, is not binding and is not part of the court record. Also, anything the parties submit is excluded from the court record. Unless the parties consent, typically the settlement conference judge will not preside over the trial.    Again, the most efficient way to be prepared for the settlement conference is to just call the judge's chambers and ask about his or her particular manner of handling the conferences."
1824155,"You should speak to a local medical malpractice attorney in your area.  The attorney that you choose will likely need more information than you have provided above in order to evaluate your case. More specifically, a medical malpractice attorney will need your medical records from the provider that was dispensing the testosterone to you.  If you were referred to this physician by your Primary Care Physician, they will also likely need those records as well.  Finally, any treatment related to the blood clots will also be needed.  Please note that Florida requires that a medical provider in the same field that you are proposing to bring the suit file an affidavit stating exactly where the proposed Defendant fell below the standard of care. According to your summary above, it appears that your current physician is indicating that the blood clots are a direct result of the testosterone.  Try and see if your physician will also talk to the attorney that you will be consulting with.  Once you speak with an attorney, then decisions such as whether you qualify as a member of a class action or whether you have any claim at all can be determined. In addition, you do not have to take the opinion of just one attorney, if they believe that you do not have a claim, you can also ways get a second and third opinion.  Work quickly though, medical malpractice actions have a two year statute of limitations in Florida. Good luck."
1790256,"The penalty for possessing less than 10 grams of marijuana in Maryland is currently 90 days and a $500 fine, or both.  The new law does not go into affect until October 1, 2014, and you cannot postpone your case until after that date and ask for that penalty.  The new law in Maryland is a civil citation and the first offense max fine is $100.00.  However, this may be deceiving in a couple of aspects.  1) It will still appear in the Maryland Judiciary Case Search and employers and schools will still be able to see the conviction for a civil citation.  2) most police officers still charge possession of paraphernalia, which is still criminal, and a must appear offense in Maryland. I would contact an attorney and have that attorney work with the State's Attorney's Office in trying to resolve the charges.  Your prior record may hurt that effort, but a lawyer can still help you.  The SCOTUS did rule that police now have to have a warrant to go into someone's phone, but the State would probably argue that your consented that the search.  Hire a lawyer and let him fight the charges, contact my office and I will discuss in depth your options."

1826432,"Here are solid tips to help you to hire a lawyer.  By Alan Brinkmeier  1Check Background  Always check background, experience, and disciplinary record before you hire the lawyer. You should inquire about the specifics of a lawyer's background while you are trying to determine whether to retain the attorney or not. Check with the Board of Professional Responsibility to see if the lawyer has been publicly disciplined and why? Make sure you drill down into the details to make sure you know your attorney's record.  2 Do Interviews about Experience and CLEs   Consider interviewing more than one lawyer before you make your final choice. Ask if the lawyer has handled similar matters, and what the outcomes were. Also ask if the lawyer has taken any continuing legal education courses which relate to your problem. Going it alone, you can miss and say the wrong things if you are not represented by an advocate as your attorney. This is why experience is a necessary line of inquiry as you look for a skilled counselor.  3 Confirm Fees  Find out from the lawyer what you will be charged for the legal services provided. Just because a lawyer's fee is higher, that does not always indicate competence to properly handle your matter.  4 Seek Referrals  Ask your friends, family, business associates, or other acquaintances about lawyers they have used. Chances are you will come up with at least a few names.   5 Interview  Feel comfortable with your lawyer after you conduct the interview at the lawyer's office. Trust is essential."
1799662,"This is a sensative matter that should be addressed in private with an attorney, not on a public forum.  Backdating anything is typically a bad idea."
1815322,"If you trust your lawyer and your getting what you want then it would be safe to say he is doing his job.  1. If you have concerns bring them to the attention of your lawyer.  2. The Judge controls what and how he/she wants things conducted in her/his courtroom.  3. Family matters become very contentious. Parties are usually not willing to work things out.  4. This will cause both parties more money and stress and they start to doubt their attorneys ability to represent them. I assure attorneys do not like to lose. 5. However,  if the parties can't agree on something and your attorney is unable to get you the results you want.  The judge will call them into chambers.  This is usually the case when your attorney is fighting hard for you, yet the parties cannot come to an agreement.   6. The Judge will make a ruling neither party will be happy with.  7. Best of luck."
559156,"All parties have the right to review the other parties' documents prior to any hearing.  There are two remedies for not serving the other party a document in the time prescribed by the rule.  The judge can allow a continuance so the other party has time to respond or the document can be excluded.  If you serve the document the day of the hearing the case will probably be continued with the temporary order remaining in place, but you do risk the chance that the document will not be adopted into the record and the permanent order will be entered.  Service must be done (1) in person, (2) by a person over the age of 18 and (3) by a person who is not a party to the case.  Having a process server deliver the document is the best way to do this so that you avoid any allegations of violating the temporary order.  Delivering any message, outside of your response declaration, through a third party may also be a violation of the order.   You can find a proof of service form on the Washington Courts website, along with declaration forms and other important documents."

The Motion for Default is then heard so that the court can determine whether the parental rights of the biological parents can be terminated.  You need to ask your attorney whether or not you need to be present when the Motion comes up for hearing.    With regard to the Guardian ad Litem, every county has a slightly different procedure for GALs.  Again, your best resource for how this is to be handled is to consult with your attorney and get the answers that you need."

1824384,"You need to review everything with a local landlord-tenant attorney. IF the rental truly is illegal as a dwelling, then that will be an absolute defense for failing to pay rent, since you owe no rent for an illegal dwelling - indeed, you may be entitled to recover everything you have paid to date.  Otherwise, you may or may not have a problem.  Habitability issues normally may qualify you for owing a reduced amount of rent but not excuse paying rent at all.  A landlord's failure to deliver what was promised may also be a breach of the agreement and allow you to get out of the lease or sue for damages but does not directly get you past a pay rent or get out notice.  All this, again, is best evaluated in your particular case by a local landlord-tenant attorney.  The unit was vacant for over a year but they still did not clean up the blood from a murdered tenant?  Something sounds either very fishy or in likely violation of housing, health, and/or landlord-tenant laws.  Good luck.  Greg Abbott Consumer Law Northwest 6635 N.

2014802,"Your ex is not correct about your ability to be involved in the decisions about your children.  That is exactly what joint legal custody means:  both of you must be involved in any important decision.  You should be able to attend any appointment, school function, etc., and to take the children to any of these on your custodial time.  No court I know of will issue an order telling one party they can ""never be able to"" take the children on their appointments unless there is some abuse issue, which I gather there isn't.  I would probably suggest you file your own Request for Order and ask that these things be detailed, because obviously your ex thinks he can do it all himself.    Consult an attorney first.  Good luck."
1816347,"No, he can't evict you just because you don't get along  with the owner.  If you have a lease for a set period of time, such as 2 years, then the only way you can be evicted is if you violate the lease (such as not paying rent or committing crimes on the property).  On the same note, you also can't end the lease and move out before the 2 year term ends (unless you find another tenant to replace you etc etc.)"

This definition has been used to tax in prizes, bartered goods, and in kind benefits. Determine whether you meet the three parts to the definition of income. Has your wealth increased? Can you identify the point in time when your wealth increased?  Do you have possession, dominion and control over the money? If so, you have income.

1802712,"From the facts you have provided, it certainly seems that the contractor breached the contract to build the addition in accordance with the architectural plan.  You need to contact a local attorney to discuss your options (many offer free initial consultations).

There are potential claims against the employer for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) discrimination, but that is complicated by the doctor's note. There is also a pregnancy-related claim, and that seems more certain. However, both of these areas are extremely fact-intensive and it is not possible to answer your question asking how to prove discrimination here on Avvo.    urge you to consult with one or more experienced employment law attorneys with whom you can discuss the details of your situation because you need an assessment of the specific facts.

Here is a summary of state and federal rights regarding pregnancy:  FEDERAL RIGHTS:  In 1978, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII 42 U.S.C. å¤å¤ 2000e to 2000e‰ÛÒ17, by passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.   Under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, ""discrimination"" means to treat a pregnant employee differently from non-pregnant employees, and adversely. The employee must be able to make a connection between the discriminatory treatment and the protected status (being pregnant). In other words, the employee will have to show that her pregnancy is reason the employer is treating her adversely. There are various ways to do this. Negative comments from supervisors or management; a sudden change in treatment (for the worse) as soon as or shortly after the employer learns about the pregnancy or the effects of pregnancy; or other incriminating conduct. Note it is not unlawful for an employer to apply the same leave of absence policy to pregnant and non-pregnant employees.   For information on pregnancy discrimination, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/types/pregnancy.cfm   For information on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, see:  http://eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm   This law is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). www.EEOC.gov   Under federal law, leave taken for an employee's incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions is governed by the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. section 2101 et seq. (FMLA), just like leave for any other ""serious health condition"" of an employee.  See my Avvo guide to the FMLA for more information: http://www.avvo.com/pages/show?category_id=6&permalink=family-and-medical-leave-fmla-summary-of-key-provisions.  (continued in Comment below)"
1850358,You should strongly consider hiring an attorney to assist you. The eviction is just one step in resolving the matter. When was the eviction? You only have five days to appeal. You need to get the paperwork from the court for the appeal and most likely a pauper's affidavit. You might consider calling local attorney Conrad Beyer for assistance or even look outside of local attorneys until you find someone who can help you at a price you can afford.
1800091,"The interesting wrinkle in your question is that you wrote your book and have been receiving your royalties before you came here. It is income for work that was done abroad before you came here. You have to beware of doing any work that is unauthorized by your status, so you'd probably have an interesting short meeting with an attorney to clarify this for you and to work out what is the safest way to be paid. the attorney you find will need to be multi-talented.  Good luck. First lesson as a new non-immigrant resident. It is worth getting a health check from an attorney - just like you would for a doctor. Don't crowdsource your life in the internet, and don't self medicate. Be safe."
1812590,"If by your ""own insurance"" you are referring to your health insurance, there's not really a downside. Your health insurer would likely have a lien (right to reimbursement) out of any settlement you get on your auto accident claim. In other words, if health insurance pays for your surgery they may be entitled to get some or all of their money back from your car wreck claim. Sounds to me like your injury is playing havoc with your finances, so if you have health insurance you can use to pay for your care and get you on the path to recovery, your long term health and ability to make a living is WAY more important than putting some money in your pocket from the settlement.  If on the other hand by your ""own insurance"" you're talking about your car insurance, such as uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, that requires a different answer (which I can provide if you comment to clarify).  I've included some links below to AVVO video guides I've made on issues that may apply to your situation. Hope you get better. A (free) consultation with a good personal injury lawyer may bring you some clarity and peace of mind. You're spoiled for choice in the Houston area."
1824764,This could even be criminal in nature of criminal impersonation or ID theft. I would contact the police and a civil litigation attorney to file an injunction to stop her using your name to advertise or promote her books.
1799837,"You should submit copy of the EAD approval notice and/or expiring EAD along with the form.  Might be a good idea also to submit copy of the asylum application receipt notice. As for the fee, only the initial EAD is automatically free. You may, however, apply for a fee waiver if you are eligible."
1799624,"Very few attorneys are going to know the answer to this question. You need to deal with Immigration directly.   Was the case dismissed or just expunged? Because if it was dismissed and expunged--that would help a lot. If it was a conviction that was expunged--you might be out of luck.   Get all the documents that prove innocence and send them to everyone at Immigration and request guidance on how to have the refusal reviewed.   And if your family member applies again, MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE that information regarding the case being expunged."
2314950,You asked this before and we answered already. You can get readmitted on your H4 provided it is valid and so is the underlying H1.
1809891,"Yes. Several ways. There should be a public utilities commission that regulates both the slammer utility and the company that is charging you an early termination fee.  The slammer should actually pay the early termination fee for unlawfully slamming you into a contract you did not agree to and terminating the pre-existing contract you were in.  Also the company you are with should sue the slammer for unfair competition and violation of various state and federal laws.  If you cannot get relief, I would suggest contacting a consumer protection lawyer in your area by clicking on ""Find a Lawyer"" above. It is possible you could sue both utilities for fraud, especially if your pre-existing utility knew that the slammer utility was unlawfully terminating everyone, thereby triggering these fees and enriching both utilities.  Its not uncommon. It happened in the long-distance carrier business 20 years ago, the cell phone business 10 years ago, and continues with cable TV and satellite and trash hauling industries today."
1802138,"Yes, you can take action against a creditor employing abusive tactics like the one you described. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) can be an important tool in curbing these types of action. And because plaintiffs in FDCPA cases can usually recover their attorneys fees if successful, attorneys normally represent people in your position on a contingency basis.   I would recommend my old firm, Drewes Law, PLLC. www. dreweslaw.com. They do a lot of consumer protection in general, FDCPA in particular."
1794836,"I am assuming your husband is either a green card holder or a US Citizen.  Your husband would NOT be eligible to file a family-based petition for you (under a law known as the Adam Walsh Act) if he was convicted of any ""specified offense against a minor"", i.e.: ""kidnapping; false Imprisonment; solicitation to engage in sexual conduct; use in sexual performance; solicitation to practice prostitution; video voyeurism (use of a webcam to watch children); possession, production, or distribution of child pornography; criminal sexual conduct involving a minor, or the use of the internet to facilitate, or attempt such conduct; and any conduct that by its nature is a sex offense against a minor.""  A felony domestic violence conviction that did not involve any of the above should not invalidate your husband's ability to file an immigrant petition for you, but I agree with my colleagues that you are best advised to seek a green card via a VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) self-petition based on the violence you suffered at the hands of your husband, which can be consular processed abroad.  Your husband has no involvement in the process.   I am attaching a link with more information on the VAWA process.  Good luck to you and please stay safe."
1820840,"If you are being harassed BECAUSE of a serious medical condition or disability or BECAUSE you asserted your right to overtime pay in good faith, you may have a claim for unlawful harassment or discrimination.   IF you are a nonexempt employee (depends on your duties) and you worked over 8 hours in a workday or over 40 hours in a workweek (don't count meal periods), you may be owed overtime if your claim is not older than 3 and sometimes 4 years.   If you believe you have a claim, call an employment law attorney to discuss.   It is not unlawful for your boss to require that you keep track of all of your work time and they can insist that you don't work over 8 hours in a workday if they don't want to pay overtime.   Many of us offer a free initial phone consultation and you can find attorney contact info on Avvo.com."
1799645,"It could be discrimination for pregnancy - because NO pregnant woman who followed normal procedure for not drinking during a pregnancy would be allowed in. However, your damages have to be converted to monetary ones, which are fairly low or nonexistent."
1820643,"Your fiancÌ©e can petition for you, the only issue is that you will need to have a co-sponsor who is willing to sign the affidavit of support. It can be anyone  like friend, relative, as long as the person is a US citizen or legal permanent resident."
1791096,"All we can say is that if it's been over a year and this was your only arrest, then the whole thing should have been dismissed and sealed by now. Whether or not they hire you is a completely different matter. Remember that an ACOD means you were not found guilty nor convicted of anything."
1727100,Yours is not a quesiton. It is a rant. Take the complaint to your local Congressional representative. Insist they rewrite the law. Many lawyers would support your efforts without making any money in the process.
1799275,"Just file for the N-400 and don't waste your time (and precious money) on none sense and useless things such as the I-90 GC replacement at this stage. You'll be able to do that for free at the N-400 stage - for free, I might add.."
1823712,"I am very sorry to hear about your fall and the injuries you sustained. First, it's important that you continue to seek medical care for your injuries. See your regular doctor or medical provider, if you have one. If you do not have any medical insurance, an attorney may be able to help you see a doctor anyway. For example, I have relationships with several local doctors and have been able to arrange for my clients to obtain medical treatment at no cost to them. Your injuries sound very significant so it's important that you take this opportunity to restore your health. Although other attorneys have not taken your case, it doesn't mean that you don't have one. I encourage you to seek a consultation with an experienced personal injury attorney as it's free. It's important that an attorney obtains all of the facts quickly in order to determine if the hospital is liable. You may also have claims for pain and suffering or lost wages if the injury has kept you out of work, or both. An experienced attorney will be able to tell you how to proceed to protect your rights. I wish you the best and a speedy recovery."
1804539,"Failure to provide correct credit for time served is an error that can be corrected at any time.  But, see Mr. Kaman's answer regarding the time calculation.  Make sure you are not double counting."
1808551,"Are those her only assets?  I am sorry for you loss.  ""Joint Ownership"" can take a variety of forms. One ""right of survivorship"" means that upon her death, the other owner owns it without anything else. It all depends on the paperwork.  I recommend getting that information and taking it to a probate lawyer in Kansas (assuming that is where she lived). They can advise you if anything else is needed.   I do recommend you let your siblings know of your mother's passing. Not because there is any legal obligation."
1786952,I completely agree that damages on medmal cases are unjustified.  It is clear now that caps on noneconomic damages in wrongful death and I believe all medmal cases have been over turned.  Since the case reviewed was a wrongful death case the defense has argued that the holding is limited to WD.  This the reason that the next governors race is so very important.  Our SC should be commended for upholding equal application of rights for victims of medical negligence.
1826425,"No.  After the defense rests, you may call rebuttal witnesses, but limited to the scope of the defendant's case.  You cannot call a witness to support your case which reasonably could have been anticipated.  You may call rebuttal witnesses, after the defense rests, but the scope of a rebuttal witness's testimony generally is limited.  You may call a rebuttal witness to directly contradict the testimony of a defense witness.    Using a rebuttal witness to rebut an issue in the case is different than calling a witness to attack the defense witness's charter.    You will have a great deal of trouble introducing the testimony of a rebuttal witness that the defense witness has a reputation as a liar.  Most states have an equivalent to Federal Rule Evidence 608, which states:  (a) Reputation or Opinion Evidence. A witness's credibility may be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness's reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the form of an opinion about that character. But evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked.  (b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness's conduct in order to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness. But the court may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of:  (1) the witness; or  (2) another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about."
1828690,"No, not a violation. Under FDCPA, there is no requirement that a letter be sent prior to initiating a lawsuit.  And even when the letter is sent, collection activity, including the filing of a lawsuit, can still be done during the 30 day period. Sorry.   Your state may have specific notice requirements as part of the foreclosure process, and you would need to speak to a local attorney, but under FDCPA, this does not sound like a violation.   Big picture, collection violations as part of a foreclosure don't stop the foreclosure."
1806884,"In all likelihood, they will not claim the FHA insurance. I am not sure how you came up with that opinion."
1801762,"If fair market value rent is $1,100 and your mortgage is $1,600, then you do have a financial hardship.  If you list the home for short sale and bring in an offer that Chase believes is at fair market value, you should have a good opportunity for short sale.  There are a lot of legal issues to be aware of, so I recomend that you speak with an AZ real estate attorney who has experience with short sales.  For example, if your home is 2 1/2 acres or less, a single family home, that has been lived in, then legally you can walk away from the entire loan balance with Chase (under Arizona's anti-deficiency statute), which gives you leverage in your short sale.  There are also tax consequences for investment properites in a short sale that you need to be aware of."
1795958,"A trust is a private contract among the parties involved, the operation of law only comes into play when there is no provision in the trust relating to a certain scenario. If your trust was prepared by an estate planning attorney, it almost certainly addresses the issue you described and the answer lies in the trust document itself. Most likely the trustee is vested with the authority to manage assets and sell the property, there is very little the beneficiaries would be able to do to challenge this lawful action by the trustee. It is unlikely the trust requires all the beneficiaries to approve of a sales price for an asset, but of course anything is possible. You'd need to find the trust and have an attorney analyze it to know for sure. If you'd like to speak with an attorney about it, I'd be happy to talk to you further and analyze your situation."
2004044,"It sounds as though you have potential causes of action for fraud, breach of contract and DTPA violations subject to your providing more information. Fraud allows for punitive damages against the company. The DTPA would allow you to treble (triple) any damages you obtain from defendant. If the facts lined up and I took on the case, I'd send a DTPA letter after a thorough consultation to get the ball rolling towards litigation."
1821617,"Hello,  This is a question best answered by a Covered California health insurance agent who can review your entire situation.  Please go to the Covered California website and you can find a list of agents near you who can assist.  Good luck."
1808820,"I think it is too soon to say they are ignoring it.  However, you can ask the clerk to confirm that it was received and nothing more is needed from you."
1816473,"He should follow medical advice about working.  He should see a good work comp attorney specialist about his work injury and explore whether there is a ""3rd party"" case available."
1968082,"I would contact the court to create a record that you have been trying to reach your P.O. I woul also contact the probation office and ask to speak with a supervisor, also with the purpose of creating a record that you are doing your part to reach your P.O."
2619317,"I'm not licensed in CA and am not familiar with how your courts of limited jurisdiction handle matters like this, but it sounds to me like your judge is overreaching. Look at your court rules, there is likely an appeal process if this goes south on you to district court. Before you do, however, you should really consider what your lost opportunity cost and time will be on this if you don't resolve it. Exactly how much less than what you paid is $3,500, and is that difference worth the hassle of having to litigate this for an extended period of time on your own? I'll tell you what I tell all of my clients -- a case like this can't be about principle, it has to be about money (and the money value of your time) because you're only ever going to get money out of it, no one is going to pay you principle. This needs to be approached like a standard business deal, with as little emotion as possible. If the proposed resolution is close to what you paid out, consider taking it and moving on. As far as getting the materials to court, I'm sure you can arrange for them to be picked up or something if you explain to the court that they're simply too large to bring with you. Good luck."
1789790,"I see you have had a discussion regarding the issue with the other attorney. Keep in mind, FERPA does not require they send you an ""official"" transcript. They do have to give you your grades, as you stated, but they can print UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT on it, and state that you owe money to the institution. You are lucky that the other institution is willing to accept your unofficial one. But be careful, this may impact your degree conferment down the line. Make sure you check into that issue before you find yourself in a difficult situation later."
1796681,The funds are non marital and not subject to division.
1824948,"Agree with colleagues.  Payment of trust taxes is responsibility of trustee.  If taxes are not paid and distributions made to you, you may be liable for a portion of the unpaid taxes.  You are entitled to an accounting from trustee.  Retain counsel to file a petition for an accounting."
1804559,"Technically it is an unlawful search; however, this only means that any evidence found in your phone cannot be used against you. If he did not find any evidence of a crime in your phone then the fact that he searched your phone is moot at least in criminal law."
1820557,"Take the Title to the DMV and transfer it to him and mail it to him. or Unfortunately, report the car stolen. You are right to be SERIOUSLY concerned about a car driving around with your name on it with expired tags and potentially no insurance."
1813401,"You shouldn't have any problems adusting status now, since you were admitted with a visa and passport. The fact that you overstayed since is irrelevant since you are now married to a US citizen and will file for a green card as such.  File a Form G-639 FOIA request application to get the copy of your entire immigration file.  File the FOIA with EOIR. There is a special procedure for doing so.  Google it or go on the EOIR website and follow instructions."
1828256,"AHCCCS is not Medicare, it is Medicaid, the state's health care insurance for people with low incomes.  Any health care provider that accepts AHCCCS has the option of enforcing a lien instead of taking what AHCCCS pays.  A good personal injury attorney can negotiate with the lien holder to get them to take an amount that is smaller than the full lien but still more than AHCCCS will pay.  Or you can negotiate with the lien holder yourself.  But you can not force them to bill AHCCCS."
1800866,"Although it is not illegal to eavesdrop on a conversation among people who don't know you're listening, California Penal Code section 632 makes it illegal to use an electronic device to eavesdrop and/or record a confidential conversation without all parties' consent.  In order for a conversation to be considered confidential, it needs to occur under circumstances that reasonably indicate at least one person to the conversation (in this case the father) intends for the conversation to be private.  That's a hard sell given that (1) your daughter is a minor child speaking on your phone at your residence, and (2) you and father are involved in pending divorce proceedings where, as you've suggested indicated, you're monitoring each other's conducted.  Under those circumstances, father arguably has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his conversations with his minor daughter.  But if you want your recordings of their telephone conversations to be admitted into evidence in court, be sure each recording begins with a statement from you that you are recording the conversation, and father's statement authorizing and consent to the recording."

1791839,"If you have now received the approval from USCIS of your FORM -601A you will need to be proactive and initiate  contact with the NVC and forward your I-601A approval with all of the necessary documentation including passport sized photos, NVC fee receipts, Affidavit of Support, etc. The NVC will NOT be forwarding any type of packets to individuals who have received I-601A approvals. It is your own responsibility to move forward with these type of cases.  In regards to the processing time for the NVC to transfer the case to the U.S. consulate in Cuidad Juarez, we are experiencing 6-12 weeks. You may want to retain qualified legal counsel to make sure that you process the case as quickly as possible."
1818433,"You would need to speak to a real estate attorney.  There are several different directions you could take, depending on the details of the situation and your budget.  I would suggest you make an appointment for a consultation immediately."
1826600,"Look for a civil rights attorney here on Avvo. Attorneys that file 1983 violation of civil rights cases in federal court are relatively few and far between in CO. However, try to find 2-3 that will offer you a free consult. I just had a client try to hire one and be aware that the attorney asked for a $10,000 retainer and expected attorneys fees to exceed $100,000 and eventually determined that the case was not ""big enough"" or ""glamorous enough"" for the attorney."
1820348,"I respectfully disagree with my colleague as the Arizona Sex Offender Registration Law is not so permissive and I have represented clients who resided in states that did not require them to register and Arizona law did. Registration requirements in Arizona  are tough and very fact dependent. So my advise would be that you contact an attorney experienced in sex crimes cases and discuss the specifics of your situation with them. Many of us on Avvo offer free consultations, so I think you would be well advised to take advantage of that opportunity. Good Luck"
1816492,"Congratulations!!  Sometimes it's so darn difficult to get an I-140 approved, due to ""ability to pay"" issues with the employer.. Now that you have filed your I-485 adjustment of status application, you must be patient and wait. USCIS is deluged with tens of thousands new applications every month and can never move as fast as you would like them to.  After all, they are only human, just like you and I and there is only so much they can move in any given day, week and month. If you look at USCIS' website, you'll probably read that employment-based I-485 currently take nationwide an average of 6 months to process.  Don't you believe it.  Some take less others take more, sometimes much more, for a myriad of different reasons, with each case (and fate) being individual.  You need to remain patient and keep close contact with the highly skilled attorney that got your employer the I-140 approved. Hopefully he or she is also the one who filed the I-485 package on your behalf.  The good news here is that employment based I-485s are, for the most part, approved by the CIS Service Centers without necessitating an interview at the local USCIS district office, like the marriage=based I-485s do. Thus, if everything works out according to plan you should be receiving your green card(s) in the mail, at home, some 3-4 months from now (or even before). Keep your fingers crossed."
1828950,"If the person is just a witness and not within the control of the defendant, then a notice of deposition alone may not be enough to get the testimony of the witness; you may need a subpoena as well."
2295341,"Why are you focused on E & O? How they pay you is their problem.  You have a significant claim against seller and listing agent. The fraudulent nature of incident can not be overstated. If the listing agent worked for a major firm, merely bringing this matter to the attention of the agent's broker manager may solve your problem (don't waste time with agent). Paying for a panel is cheap, compared to many issues this fact pattern raises.  If you were represented by buyer's agent, get that firm in the boat with everyone else.  I'd suggest you consult with a real estate attorney in your area. Perhaps a broker-attorney like myself, with connections to the brokerage community. You should review the dispute resolution section of your sales contract, so you can talk about process with your attorney.  As a mediator serving on the California Association of Realtors consumer panel, I can tell you this situation is explosive. Politely demand that the seller and listing brokerage make you whole. Let them figure out how to pay the costs, to avoid really serious ramifications."
1821904,You face re-sentencing up to the maximum jail sentence allowed for the crime you were convicted of less any jail time already served on the case.
1795154,"In NC the Attorney General's office is not normally involved in this sort of matter, so I would find that highly unusual and suspicious.  Unless the case involved some very complicated matters of fraud or some other issue of particular interest to the AG's office they would not place such a call.  Typically you find out that charges have been taken out when the police come and serve those warrants on you. Then the local DA's office handles the prosecution.  The AG would not be involved until the case had worked its way up through the appellate process after a trial except under some very rare circumstances."
1791382,"There is also a possible method whereby your siblings assert their right to a share of the benefits and you agree or ""compromise"" with them.  This has to be a legitimate, legally documented process otherwise you will be deemed to be making gifts."
1804580,"I've read the other answers and I would suggest that you hire an attorney to make one court appearance and give him all of the dates you are available.  At most the court is likely to issue a bench warrant for your arrest but hold it in the file until the date you advise the attorney that you can appear.  If you failed to appear on that date the judge would lift the hold on the warrant and you would be subject to arrest on the warrant.   Although you didn't ask about this, you may want to consult a local DUI attorney on the merits of the DUI.  I recently got a 0.20 BAC second time ""cut and dry"" DUI dismissed at the DMV and in court.  I don't practice in your area so this isn't a pitch for business."
1818647,"You should hire a criminal defense attorney in your area, and particularly one that is familiar with the policies and procedures in your circuit's drug court.   The first order of business would be to have the capias (or bench warrant) withdrawn.  It is possible that you may have been charged with a subsequent felony for failing to appear for your next scheduled court date (if the underlying charge was also a felony, and I am assuming it was).  Transferring your supervision out of state is not likely in drug court.  While the policies differ from county to county, one of the common features is frequent court dates with local drug counseling providers who can provide accurate and up to date information to the court on your progress.  This cannot be accomplished effectively from another state.  You may be able to transfer, however, if you can ""opt out"" of drug court.  Make sure you fully understand all the implications of that decision before you make it.  It sounds like there will be some options for you here, but again, talk to a local criminal attorney.  I hope this helps - good luck."
1815228,"You didn't say whether the contempt involves child support or alimony or both. All states have a strong interest in making sure child support is paid. If support services gets involves, then the state of NC may take charge of the enforcement. If your finances have changed you should modify the support orders. Support orders can not be discharged in bankruptcy."
1798321,"The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the use of background reports, and provides you with several rights that are relevant to your situation.  For the sake of making this an easily readable list of those rights, I‰Ûªve outlined them in a short list below.  This list only skims the surface of your rights and potential claims.  What you‰Ûªre going through is very frustrating, and can be damaging in many ways.  Our firm litigates FCRA claims around the country.  We are more than happy  to speak with you in further detail.  1.  Accuracy of information in the report:  The FCRA requires that background check companies use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of the content of a background report.  The use of two personal identifiers oftentimes does not meet this standard, particularly where the background check company could have reviewed additional information by pulling court records.    2.  Up to date information in the report:  The FCRA also requires that background report companies who report adverse public record information must either: (1) notify the applicant/employee that it will report such information about them; or (2) use strict procedures to ensure that the information is complete and up to date.  3.  Notices:   The FCRA requires employers to provide a ""pre-adverse action notice"" to an employee/applicant BEFORE taking an adverse employment action based on information in a background report.  The pre-adverse action notice includes a copy of the background report and a summary of your rights under the FCRA. The purpose of the pre-adverse action notice is to allow the employee/applicant an opportunity to clear up any misstatements in the report and to address any misunderstandings the report may have created in the employer‰Ûªs mind. For this reason, the pre-adverse action notice must be provided to the employee/applicant before the employer takes the adverse employment action (i.e., there must be some delay in time between when the employee is given the pre-adverse action notice and when the employer takes the adverse employment action).  If an employer does not provide you with a copy of the background report before it chooses not to hire you, then you may have claims to pursue under the FCRA.    4.  Damages:  The FCRA provides several different types of remedies, including actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys‰Ûª fees.  Based on the circumstances you described, you should speak with an experienced FCRA attorney to discuss your potential claims."
1799237,"I like the information that you have been given, but here is the long and short of it. IF you are an heir in your mother's estate and IF your share of the estate would be increased by the money your brother took being returned to the estate, you are an interested person.  If you are not an heir, or if the money comes back your share is not increased, then you are NOT an interested person.  One exception is that if you are the Executor of your mother's estate, you could also force the accounting even if you personally get nothing, but if the estate is enriched.  If you are an interested person, you can have an attorney who is experienced with the Philadelphia Orphans' Court petition the court to force your brother to account for all of his actions as Agent under the Power of Attorney.  We do these petitions regularly, as what you describe is not uncommon.  The Orphans' Court judges in Philadelphia are excellent, and they will force your brother to account for every penny of what he handled as the Agent.  If it turns out that he cannot explain why the money ended up in his account, then the judge will ""surcharge"" him, which means force him to return the money to the estate.  This process is not lightning fast, but the judges are good and in the end you will get your answer.  You need to speak to an Orphans' Court lawyer review the facts of this case and give you an opinion about the exact facts of your case and, if the facts look favorable, act quickly to file the Petition."
1811921,"Unfortunately, even charges that have been dismissed and expunged will indeed remain in ""non-public"" federal law enforcement databases, and there is likely no legal way to remove them.  Indeed, many states (such as Tennessee) legally require the state Bureau of Investigation to maintain a ""non-public"" record of all arrests and expungements.  Moreover, expunged charges may also remain in other private databases.  When a person is arrested in the internet age, that information is often recorded by ""private"" background check companies and other keepers of information on the internet.  Expungement can certainly seal or destroy public court records, and other public government documents, which can certainly help with employers and others, so anyone with a dismissed case should pursue expungement with a local attorney.  However, private companies that recorded the arrest through public records at the time of the arrest are under no duty to destroy their records, and a person may be able to learn of the arrest through search engines, news reports, private companies, and other sources.  The best advice is to expunge all public records that can legally be expunged, after obtaining certified court records to prove the case was dismissed and expunged.  Then, if questions are later raised by employers or anyone, the person can prove that he or she was innocent, and that the case was dismissed prior to being expunged."

1810033,"The new case that just came out that pertains to your issue is the 5th DCA Case of US Bank v. Bartram. Essentially, this case threw out the 5 year Statute of Limitation rule, but the the appellate court did recognize the matter is one ""of great importance"" and therefore certified it to the Florida Supreme Court for further review. However, there is language in the opinion indicating even though the bank can file a new foreclosure suit, it may not seek to recover any individual payment that is more than five years overdue. This will present significant challenges for bank who will need to figure out what they can sue for. In addition, some banks may find it impractical to ""charge off"" those months that are past the 5 year date - but don't count on this!) Its a good idea to consult with a foreclosure attorney familiar with the statute of limitations and how it will pertain to your issue."
1793193,"In the type of case you have described, if the vehicle is available when the attorney is retained, an inspection must be conducted promptly in order to determine the viability of a products liability case.

Once the vehicle is gone so is the products liability case. Therefore preserving the vehicle in a secure storage facility is essential."

A ""civil suit"" will not be filed. No agency will file a suit on which it knows it cannot collect ,for the simple reason that the person sued might be ""judgment proof' an indigent foreign national with no assets or income in the US. No you as the son are not responsible for their unpaid bills, unless you co-signed as the responsible party for them when admitted to the hospital."
1825009,"Sounds to me that a small claims action may be in order based on the information provided from your post.  Based on the information provided, which is difficult to fully grasp, you might have civil remedies, or even a situation prevelant to filing a police report.  As far as filing criminal charges against the Seller.  That would require you to file a police report stating that factually the seller intentionally took your money with knowledge that he never owned the trailer to do nothing other than defraud you.  I am not sure based on the information provided if this is a simple oversight with the transfer of the registration to the person who ultimately sold you the trailer, from his or her prior purchase, or if the seller to your transaction actually intended to defraud you.  Regardless, depending upon what information you provided to the officer, the officer may immediately qualify this as a civil action if the officer determines that this is simply an oversight of transferring the registration.  However, from a civil standpoint, you could initiate suit in small claims against the seller for selling you the trailer and not transferring title.  You can request the Court to either force the seller to transfer the title to you, through performing the transfer of the title from the original party he or she purchased it from directly to you, or otherwise, request that the Court cancel the transaction for selling you property that he didn't have the right to sell and returning the trailer to the seller by some right of rescission.  Good luck!  I suggest that you speak with counsel to fully discuss the scope of the transaction and shortfalls regarding the registration transfer to afford an attorney to review the documentation from the sale and fully advise you.  Unfortunately, the complexity of the transfers, or lack thereof, between the multiple sales of this trailer clouds the issue, and requires more information to fully advise you as to your rights."

If you had been found guilty, it would be more than an obstacle. You have to declare it otherwise you are misrepresenting a material fact - even if that fact would not have changed their decision. And that would make you inadmissible.Your fiancÌ© in the US hopefully discussed all this with an attorney when preparing the petition. Simple rules 1) tell the truth when asked.

Ok, so something tells me that you really do not know what is going on and should speak with the defendant's attorney, or someone who can tell you what is going on.

1824369,"Generally speaking a family law court cannot make a spousal support order that leaves the payor spouse without the means to support him or her self.     First question is: did you have an attorney represent you?  If so, you should run these questions by your attorney and ask if your attorney has appellate experience.  If not, you should consult an appellate lawyer.  If you did not have an attorney, you should seek the advice of a family law attorney immediately.     Depending on timing, you may still have the right to file a motion for reconsideration.  That motion is guided by strict standards, however, and you must be sure that you have grounds (other than the fact that the order imposes burdens on you).    You also have the right to appeal.  Whether an appeal will help you in the short term is a difficult issue, however, because an appeal alone does not suspend your obligation to make support payments,       You are best advised to consult with an appellate specialist who handles family law appeals.  You can find us on the AVVO find a lawyer feature."
1998429,"I agree with Attorneys Straus and Reed.  If you have completed all your disclosures and discovery, you can file an ""At Issue"" memorandum.  If you have an upcoming Family Resolution Conference, and all parties have been served/appeared and discovery is complete and Preliminary and Final Disclosures are completed and sent out, then you can ask for a Mandatory Settlement Conference date and/or Trial date.  If the parties are in agreement as to all the issues of the case, you can prepare a stipulated judgment and marital settlement agreement and file it with the court.  Sometimes it takes a couple months for the judgment to process through the court system, but having the judgment entered is the best way to wrap up the case quickly.  If discovery is not finished, then you will need to finish it first.  It is unclear what is causing the delay in your case.  You will definitely want to go into more specific detail with a family law attorney in your area if you are representing yourself in the divorce.  You can also speak with the facilitator's office at the courthouse to help you process any paperwork that is needed to move your case along.  Hope this is helpful at least a little bit.  Good luck."

1798488,"I am not sure what you are alleging. If by medical abuse, you mean that as a patient, you were mistreated, and injuries were not documented, any proof that you have showing that your condition was actually worse at an earlier point would definitely need to be considered by the Social Security Administration. If you are claiming that you were sent for a consultative examination, and a report was prepared without a full exam, again this is something that has to be considered when determining the validity of the report. If the physician was found to have committed fraud, Social Security should consider it in the disability process, but that doesn't mean that the report will hold no weight.  The most important thing is that any of your allegations are well documented by both you and any witnesses to the activities. I would suggest affidavits be signed if you are alleging fraudulent behavior during a disability exam. If you prove that the exam was not valid, it may not be used as evidence to show that you have the ability to work, but that doesn't mean you will be approved for benefits.  I am sorry if I misunderstood your question. If I did, please leave a comment below, and I will try to clarify my response. You definitely would want an attorney to be involved in either of the allegations that I specified. It would be important that legal steps be taken to document the alleged abuses, and to make sure to make an objection to the evidence being used for these reasons in any decision."
1828192,"In Georgia, if an original Will cannot be found and the Will was last known to be in the possession of the person who made it (in this case, your mother), then the fact that the Will cannot be found creates a presumption in the law that the person who made the Will later destroyed it with the intent to revoke it by doing so. That's what you will be facing if you try to probate a copy of the Will (conformed or otherwise). In order to overcome the presumption that your mother revoked her Will be deliberately destroying it, you need to come up with ""clear and convincing evidence"" that rebuts the presumption. That's not necessarily an easy standard. It may well be easier and less time-consuming to assume that she did revoke it and file a petition for administration of an intestate estate. One thing to check before you do that is to contact the probate court for any county in which your mother lived when she wrote that Will. Ask very specifically whether any Will was filed with the Court ""for safekeeping"" under your mother's name. The original may turn up that way. If not, well, then you will need to determine whether you think you can produce the needed evidence that the Will was not destroyed by her with the intent to revoke it.  However, whichever course you decide to pursue, you really do need to consult an experienced probate attorney. For one thing, the fact that you state you have to probate now because you discovered a stock certificate which was not mentioned in the Will is incorrect: either you have to probate because your mother's probate estate has at least one asset in it or the probate estate has no assets in it. A Will is not required, and in fact ideally should not, try to describe all of the assets, and just because the Will describes specific assets does not mean that it can control those assets without first being admitted to probate.  It's also not clear why time is of the essence. In probate matters, things don't normally happen quickly, nor, generally, should they. You need to make sure things are being handled correctly, and that should be the concern, not necessarily how quickly. The fact that your mother has been deceased since March 2014 and you are just now even thinking about whether the Will should be probated is a good sign that things may not be happening correctly. Please do yourself a favor soon, before you end up creating big problems for yourself, and hire a good probate attorney to help you with this."
1805001,You will most certainly have to retain an attorney to see whether you have a case.  It is likely that you signed a bunch of paperwork that states facts contrary to your summary of facts.

If this is a Board of Realtors form contract, there is a deadline by which you must get a response from the lender, or not. If you missed the deadline to cancel and remained in contract, you may have lost the right to demand return of the funds. Also, the standard Board of Realtors form has mandatory mediation provisions, so you cannot rush to court.

A case like this may, and likely will, take lots and lots of time to handle properly.

1790200,"I suggest you call the mortgage lender and see if they can help you at all.  This can be a very frustrating process, so you will have to be patient.  However, the mortgage lender is the only party that can consent to your removal from the mortgage and deed.  If you are not removed, and your ex defaults on the mortgage, it is critical to know whether you signed the mortgage note as well.  A ""mortgage"" is often seen as a single document or commitment, but there are actually two different things going on.  The first is that one or more of the owners of the home sign a mortgage note, which is a personal promise to repay the loan.  The second is that all the owners (everyone named on the deed) sign a mortgage instrument, which grants the lender a right to foreclose on the house if the mortgage note is not repaid on time and in full.  If you DID NOT sign the note, then the lender has no right to come after you once they foreclose on the house. If you DID sign the note, you are technically liable for any amount of the note not repaid through the foreclosure.  However, many lenders will forgive this ""deficiency"" and not force you to repay it.  But not all - you should ask your lender this when you speak to them.  Keep in mind that if any of your debt is forgiven, there are income tax effects - the forgiven amount is treated as income to you in the year of forgiveness.  But it's better than having to pay the whole amount.   You ask if an LLC will protect your personal assets.  It is possible, but there are serious issues with doing this.  If you put truly personal assets into the LLC, they may not be protected from creditors, since they are not really used in your business.  Further, transferring these assets into an LLC knowing that you have outstanding debts may be considered a transfer in fraud of creditors, and the transfer could be voided.  If you are an owner of the house with your boyfriend, you may be able to seek to partition the house (i.e., sell it and split the proceeds).  You should consult a lawyer familiar with real estate litigation and tell him/her all the facts."

1815480,Many assets are estate tax free when they pass to the heirs.  However many annuities have an income tax deferral component while the annuitant is alive.  But once the annuitant starts taking distributions or if an heir takes distributions some or all of the income tax free deferral may now be taxable.  The rules are difficult to understand.  I recommend that you find a good CPA locally to help you calculate what the income tax may be.  It usually is not the entire amount because much of the annuity is a return of principal.

1800416,"This is a difficult question to answer as there are details not provided. However, Judges routinely order co parenting counseling when parents are at odds with each other. If it will be a financial or other unreasonable burden to abide by the ordered counseling, you might work with your attorney on an alternative to present to the Judge along with your reasons why what was ordered is an unreasonable burden.  Frankly, if the accusations are false that may very well be made obvious through the counseling.  You should talk to your attorney about options and a game plan for how to approach and be successful in the counseling if there is no other alternative."

1815598,"It sounds like what you received was a motion for summary judgment, with supporting papers. If so, what you need to do is respond (not appeal). You will need to file a response brief, which presents your version of the facts and your legal arguments for why the motion should be denied. The facts in your response brief need to be backed up by evidence that you will submit to the court through declarations of witnesses (including yourself) signed under penalty of perjury. That is how you will show the court what the truth is. Each witness must testify on the basis of their own personal knowledge. You can attach documents to the declarations. If you do, the witness must testify in the declaration that the document is a true and correct copy of whatever it is. Check the papers you received for the date of the scheduled hearing. Your response must be filed with the court and served on the other parties no later than 11 days prior to the hearing. Also make sure you show up for the hearing to argue your position. Your best friend in defending against a motion for summary judgment is a dispute of material fact. If you can show that there are facts in dispute that would affect the outcome of the case, that means the case needs to go to trial. The judge will have to deny the motion. If you have already had judgment entered against you, that is when it is time to consider an appeal. You have 30 days from the date of the judgment (there should be a document titled ""Judgment"") to file a notice of appeal. I recommend that you consult with an attorney to help you understand what you need to do and make sure you have the proper papers in order."

At any rate, hire an attorney ASAP."

1796673,"Thank you for your question!  Ok, first off, the landlord cannot put in brand new stuff, that is substantially more expensive than what was there before.  If they do this, then they are liable for the amount above the reasonable cost of replacement, not you.  So, if that affects their deductible, then that could be an offset for you, as far as their claim for damages.  They have to find a reasonably similar or, failing that, a reasonable cost of replacing the damaged property.  As for the washing machine, it depends on how it happened.  If the problem with the washer existed before you rented, wasn't readily discoverable by you, and you did not have knowledge of any defect, it may not be your fault.  However, if the problem arose, because you weren't taking care of the washer like you agreed, you caused the problem, or you knew about an issue when you moved in and didn't take care of it, you will be on the hook for the damage.  The landlord must have had no knowledge of an existing defect when you entered the premises and/or the problem was not caused by the washer, but by a condition existing in the pipes or other part of the house, that is out of your control or responsibility.  I recommend getting an attorney to look at this."

1819225,"For the best information about how and why a federal sentence was imposed in a specific case, the best resource would indeed be the defense attorney who handled the case.  Attorneys will provide a defendant with his or her file, including information about sentencing.  Federal sentencing is complex, and is based on a variety of both statutory principles, possible mandatory minimum terms, and applicable guidelines, so the sentence may be based on more than simply a single guideline.  As a general matter, every federal defendant receives a ""pre-sentence investigation report"" which will contain guidelines estimates and other information, so that is one resource.  The sealed Judgment and Statement of Reasons filed by the court after sentencing will also be provided to the attorney and defendant, and it will provide information about the sentence and why it was imposed.  A defendant could also pay to obtain a transcript of the sentencing hearing, during which the Court would have stated the reasons for the sentence.  Finally, there are a variety of online resources at the US Sentencing Commission with information about general guidelines."

They won't arrest you unless there is a warrant.  If your probation officer violates you and the judge issues a warrant, you'll be arrested.  If your probation officer doesn't know you're gone (which they will if you're on any sort of alcohol detection device), there likely won't be.  But why take the chance?  Pay your attorney to go in and get permission from the judge for you to travel on vacation."

1800502,"Using the intellectual property, be it trademarks or copywritten materials, of another generally carries liability and/or risk.  While criticism, news, and etc. can be areas where you would be permitted to use another's intellectual property, you may be using more than the amount permitted.  For example, it is almost certain a reviewer could write a review of a new BMW car and mention it is a BMW by name.  It is not so certain they could avoid liability if they used BMW's logo or advertising material, too.    So, while there may be ""fair use"" arguments to be made, an attorney will need to review the specifics of your blog to make that determination."

1816724,"regarding custody - his court appointed attorney is not a family law attorney and his court appointed attorney is trying to do what is best for him, so do not take everything that attorney tells you as gospel.  If there is no custody order in place that says you have to let him see your child, then you are not violating any order or law if you do not let him see your child.  On the flip side - because there is no custody order in place, he would not be violating any order or law if he decided not to return your child to you.  Your best bet is to get a custody order in place before your child goes to stay with him again.  You can get a custody order entered in a custody action or in a civil domestic violence action.  It sounds like you are in the middle of a criminal  action regarding domestic violence, but you can still file an action for a domestic violence protective order (DVPO).  Regardless of the outcome of the criminal action, having a DVPO that says he needs to stay away from you, and which can establish an initial custody order, is usually a good idea."
1826108,That issue is not relevant unless you are divorcing.  It depends how close to the marriage the home was purchased.  Were you engaged at the time?  Did you go to purchase it with him?  Add any funds to the downpayment?.  You see it is a complicated issue.  Even if it is deemed non marital the funds he earbpned from his job were all marital during your marriage.  If he used those monies from his job to pay the mortgage then you contributed to the home  and may receive some monies for contribution to his non marital home.  It could also be deemed marital if it was bought in contemplation of marriage.  So go see a divorce lawyer to ponder these complex legal issues.
1981062,"There is no requirement of a face-to-face meeting, although this can be very helpful especially if the client is going to trial rather than entering a plea.  Often times getting into the jail to meet with a client can be very time-consuming.  I recommend your son use the US Mail to communicate with the attorney and lay out his concerns and possible defenses.  The attorney can research the matters and then either meet him at the jail or at least be prepared to address him in the holding cell at the court house.  Ultimately, if the attorney does not adequately address the issues which need to be understood by the client before proceeding, he (your son) can take it up with the judge, and refuse to proceed with a plea or trial until the attorney addresses things adequately."
1826101,"You are entitled to use the attorney of your choice, provided that attorney is willing to represent you.

1801136,Insurance companies don't have a set time that they must keep paying for a rental car for you. I assume your own insurance refuses to pay since husband was not on the policy.

Many people who are in the criminal justice system for the first time are scared and uncertain because they just don't know what will happen, the possible in-court and out-of court consequences.  If you get a good attorney, you will spend some money, but there's just no good substitute for competent legal representation in such a situation.  You'll sleep better and you'll likely have better outcome once you hire an attorney as soon as possible.  The damage has been done, now it's time to start protecting yourself."

1656895,"There are many excellent attorneys based in S.W. Florida who will be able to handle the case.  I am located in North Florida.  While I handle cases throughouth the State of Florida, I think you would be more comfortable with an attorney based in your geographic area.   Here are a few things to keep in mind as you pursue your case through the services of an attorney:  1. Most cases take time to resolve - 3 to 6 months or longer unless there are some unique facts to the case that allow for a settlement in shorter time span.  2. Most injury victims require from both a medical standpoint and a legal standpoint a period of time to allow the victim to obtain treatment and diagnostic testing.   The effect and severity of the injury, in most cases, cannot be determined without the benefit of time and trial / error with the differerent treatment modalities.   3.  Insurance companies are businesses that make business decisions.   Most of these business decisions are based on practices and procedures.   Most insurance adjusters will require medical records, bills, diagnostic testing, and final reports before the adjuster will put a proper value on the case.   Even when all of this information is provided, insurance adjusters may have a different opinion as to the value of the case from you and your attorney.  In many of these instances, litigation will be required in order to attempt to obtain the client a fair value or resolution of the case.  4.  Beware of any attorneys who promise the moon and the stars.  Attorneys are not fortune tellers, prophets, or super heroes.   In most cases, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the result that will be obtained on a case.    5.  Be patient.  Cases often times proceed at a slower pace than desired by a client for a variety of reasons.    I wish you all the best with your case and hope that your case is resolved in a timely fashion to your satisfaction."

1815131,"Unfortunately, Mr. Bodzin is quite correct, there is nothing illegal per se about being offensive.  At some point her behavior arguably could become a legal nuisance and subject to court action but nuisance is a difficult lawsuit to win and frankly it simply does not sound like it is winnable on these facts, at least as yet.  I do recommend that you consistently document the problems you have with her - in writing, in pictures if applicable, and/or in video if possible.  IF you ever do end up in front of a Judge again on this matter, documented evidence will help strengthen or even make/break your case.  it might also help her landlord decide to solve the problem for you.  You might also try a petition signed by as many different neighbors as you can, served on the landlord.  A tenant and a neighbor not getting along is not unusual; a tenant antagonizing a whole neighborhood is and might be a matter of concern for a responsible landlord.  Many neighborhoods have neighborhood dispute mediation programs.  Perhaps you could get the landlord to participate in a session.  None of these are ideal solutions, but they might help.  Since the neighbor herself is unable or unwilling to change her behavior, your lobbying effort should focus on the landlord or, failing that, on building a potential case for court if things get worse.

1803031,"Aside from getting her consent to separate their finances (Property Agreement), which sounds unlikely, he should hire a lawyer to file either a petition for legal separation or divorce and to move for ""ex parte"" (one party, urgent/emergent) relief to restrain her from further squandering of marital assets and also move for temporary orders that  keep his finances from being ruined by his wife.

I suppose it's possible they will run a wants and warrants check, but I doubt it.  You could always ask.  The more important question is what leads you to believe it is necessary to pull his criminal records?  If there are those kinds of trust issues, perhaps marriage is not for you.  If you just want to be double sure, you can hire a private investigator who can pull up much of that information at a much lower cost.  You also can get some of the information from a credit report, which is something you should consider looking at before you merge your lives and finances.  Good luck."

1792429,"The issue is whether the mobile home is a ""separate"" property or ""community"" property. The general rule is that ""anything"" acquired during marriage through gift, inheritance, devise, or a will is the recipient spouse's separate property. If your mom paid for the mobile home ""FULLY"" (regardless of whether it was purchased at the time of your marriage or before marriage), it is a ""gift"". On the other hand, if your mom paid ""partially"" for the mobile home, and then during marriage, you paid for the mobile home with income from employment, then you paid for the mobile home with your marital income because that income was earned ""during"" marriage. As such, your spouse will have an interest in the mobile home. If this is the case, you should definitely speak to an experienced family law attorney. If however, this is not the case, then the mobile home is a ""gift"", and since your spouse's name was never on the title, there would be no presumption that the mobile home was ""intended"" to ever be partially her's. Good luck."
1793448,"Hi  If this under PR law you will need an attorney to sort out many details: did he leave a will? If not, the law is very specific as to how the assets will be divided, who gets what and all that information.  The same will apply if he did leave a will as in PR, no will goes above the law.    There is no legal way to make them do anything...either take part or not.  The property can be undivided for years....Good Luck."

1803516,"I see you are located in Pittsfield; the Berkshire Probate and Family Court is located at 44 Bank Row.  They would certainly be able to help you file a Voluntary Statement.  The filing fee is minimal and the turn-around with the Court is very quick.  You will also need to bring an original death certificate with you to the Court.  There is no need to bring the POA or HCP as they have no impact on the filing of the Voluntary Statement.  The Statement allows you to access the assets and make the distributions in accordance with the Will.  In the (unlikely) event the $18,000 includes any interest in real estate, you cannot use the Voluntary Statement."

1795702,"Technically, child support is money paid by one parent to the other parent, and so, generally speaking to the extent a parent pays college expenses directly to the college, that isn't considered ""child support"".  But even though it doesn't meet the definition of child support, that doesn't mean those college contributions aren't relevant:  in other words, if you and your soon-to-be ex are structuring a separation agreement, you have some flexibility on what you term things (child support, alimony, contribution to college costs, asset allocation, etc.).  This is much like what you were alluding to by recognizing that alimony has a tax implication while child support is tax neutral.  And so, whether a court would consider your proposal about proportional payment of college expenses as ""fair"" will depend on how that one piece fits into the entire financial puzzle.  In other words, it may or may not be fair based on how your assets are divided, how your debts are divided, and what, if any, support is paid (whether child or spousal).  One must also consider if your son is principally dependent upon one of you or both of you equally at this point as it appears that he isn't emancipated yet.  As an attorney-mediator, when helping a divorcing couple address finances, I find it helpful to look at the whole picture first and not overly focus on terminology.  In other words, I think it's helpful to first recognize what the salaries are, what the assets/debts are, and what the expenses are; second think about how those expenses will be met given the finances while being guided by the law on support and asset allocation; and third decide what to call each thing to maximize the amount of money available in light of tax implications.  With educational expenses (and health expenses), I also like to determine the involvement level of grandparents and their gift-giving since one can pay for educational expenses without it being a taxable gift, whereas otherwise, one must consider the annual exclusion and lifetime exclusion.  With a 24 year marriage, with at least one child, there is going to be a lot to consider, so it would be wise to involve professional guidance.  As an attorney-mediator, I find mediation to be a less expensive and emotionally burdensome way to address your divorce than litigation, but some couples aren't amicable enough for mediation.  Regardless, I think your first step would be reaching out to both family law litigators and mediators for an initial consultation.  Many of us offer free initial consultations.  After you get a better understanding of what the relevant laws are and how a court might decide this, you will be in a better position to decide how you want to proceed with your divorce whether it is mediation, litigation, or some combination or the two.  There is also collaborative divorce as well.  Best of luck."
1817516,"I am sure that an attorney would review your husband's case and potentially represent him at that hearing.  But the attorney would want to talk to your husband and although you say he is on the road and can't come in, we have this modern thing called the telephone and if I were the attorney I would meet with you but insist on conferring by telephone with your husband.  You need to contact one immediately as 8/14 is just around the corner.  Good luck.  Sincerely, B. Elaine Jones, Esq."
2038934,"There are several issues to consider.  Initially, the ""Statute of Limitations.""  Statute of limitations are laws that set time limits on how long one has to file a civil lawsuit.  These limits depend on the type of legal claim.  For instance, the statute of limitations for filing a personal injury lawsuit is two years from the date of the incident.  This doesn‰Ûªt seem to be an issue in your case as you have already settled your claim against the person who caused the crash.    You also have a potential claim against your own insurance company.  Your claim will be based on breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing (bad faith), and unfair business practice, against your insurance carrier.  The statute of limitations for breach of contract in the State of Nevada is four years.  You have plenty of time to file an action against your own insurance company.   Your insurance carrier has a duty to compensate you for damages caused by the negligence of someone else.  This includes consideration of two categories of damages.  Special + General Damages.  Special damages compensate an individual for quantifiable financial losses, such as medical expenses. General damages are non-financial / non-economic damages such as pain and suffering.  They are monetary remedies awarded to compensate injured persons for their noneconomic loss of life's pleasures or the loss of enjoyment of life. Your insurance company has a duty to consider both in evaluating your claim.  It gets a bit more complicated from here.  Consult with your counsel."
1808239,"Absent using the ""find lawyer"" function, if you are looking to determine the details of such a case and how to hire a lawyer, you need to provide facts. To be clear 50% of ""defamation cases"" are not and 75% of those that are, are simply not financially viable.

1792779,"The application for R.E. Salesperson license will require you to disclose the pending case. That disclosure will cause B R E to delay approving your application.  If the case does not result in conviction, then you will likely not be denied license on that basis. If you are convicted, you will likely be placed on probation and you are likely to be denied the license. Most State licensing agencies will not issue professional/occupational license to an applicant who is presently on criminal court probation.   It is a fact that nothing that licensing  law legal counsel can do for you will be as effective for obtaining the R E license as is avoiding criminal conviction. Make the criminal case your first priority. Get outstanding local criminal defense counsel.  When the criminal case is resolved one way or another, you can assess your prospects for success with BRE. Worst case, you will need to finish your criminal probation before you apply. Maybe you can avoid the worst case."
1813499,"If this is your son's first brush with the law, you can probably resolve the matter short of a conviction.  The restitution is simply the amount of readily ascertainable damages (i.e., the cost of fixing the damage caused by your son in this case).  Any resolution may also include fines and costs.  This is assuming the prosecutor  has the evidence to press the issue.  I would advise getting a lawyer.

Also the penalties will depend on where exactly you were arrested and in particular which courthouse your case will be held in. Intent is also an important element in petty theft cases which the prosecutor will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. There are other facts that are unknown such as if there was a video, other witnesses, etc. I would consult with an attorney."
1821726,"It means that you need to schedule infopass and clarify. The guess would be that your other application was granted on the papers. Another guess would be that it was not but transferred to the local office for proceeding and the other terminated so you would not have two. the second reason, while possible would leave little sense since each application should be adjudicated on its own merit unless you are already an LPR."

1818102,"You are allowed to get your own attorney at any time that you want to.  However, just because you are not a party does not mean that they cannot subpoena the things you are asking about.  If one party is alleging that you are providing substantial support to the former spouse that party is entitled to discover (that is what they are doing with the subpoenas, deposition, production etc.) any evidence which is or may be relevant to proving that allegation, because if it is proven it can result in alimony being modified or terminated.  If the discovery is done properly, even your medical records can be subject to discovery. HIPPA does provide a lot of protection, but it is not absolute and it does not mean that your medical records are never subject to being produced in a court proceeding."
1806473,"You say you have no evidence of fraud.  Not true.  You do have evidence.  You know you did not sign any deed in front of a notary, so this is evidence.  True, this evidence depends upon your personal knowledge and will be presented by your oral testimony at court.  However, a notary public is required to keep a ledger of those person's signing in front of the notary.  Here, some notary has decided to cooperate with your father's fraud, or perhaps your father deceived the notary in some way.  There is usually a way to prove the truth of a matter.  The question is whether it is worth it to you to pay an attorney to fight this battle for you, or whether you have what it takes to fight this battle without an attorney."

1829362,"Whatever you do - DO NOT PLEAD GUILTY to this charge! No jail time, but you could still deal with a lot of fall out as a result of a guilty plea for a long time to come. If you cannot hire a lawyer, (and unless you start researching lawyers, you really don't know if you can afford one or not as every lawyer charges different fee and has payment plan options, etc) then you really should petition the court to try to get a lawyer appointed to you. You will need to bring proof of your enrollment in college and inability to work, etc. That being said, there are numerous ways to get this case dismissed later on before all is said and done. The bottom line is that you need someone to help represent you in court who can provide the answers to these questions for you. Most will not charge you to meet with them, and you may find that there is a happy middle ground in terms of their fees to help you with this case. Do your research first before you go back to court to deal with this alone...same thing goes for your girlfriend.   On a different note - be happy it was the cops who found you and not some deranged killer (google Son of Sam)  - the outcome could have been a lot worse for both of you..."

1825704,"The answer to your question is, yes. The other driver is allowed to sue. The question I would have is: Who was at fault in the accident? If your cousin hit the other driver, then she is probably responsible for the damages to the other car. The fact that nothing was done at the time of the accident is irrelevant. If the other driver is only claiming damage to their vehicle, this is likely a small claims case, and your cousin probably won't need an attorney. On the other hand, if the other driver is claiming physical injury in addition to the damage to their vehicle, your cousin would be better off seeking the advice of an attorney. More likely than not, she can find an attorney who will meet with her for a free initial consultation to go over the facts of her case and figure out which course of action she should take. Keep in mind, however, that for reasons of client confidentiality, unless you plan on paying her legal fees, your cousin will need to be the one to meet with the attorney."

One thing you mentioned is in your favor - sister arranged the new documents and they were prepared by a new attorney.  I suggest that your partner consult an estate litigation attorney and provide specific information to him or her. If mother believed that her son was stealing money & personal property and sister was the person who planted the thoughts, you might discuss slander with the attorney, also.  You may have a claim against dad's estate - but it may be too late to assert it.  You may have a claim against mom's estate when she passes.  Discuss all of these with the attorney."

Please see below for a link to the Montreal Consulate's webpage."
1824258,"This is not legal advice, but I will tell you what happened when I advised a family member on a very similar issue.  The dealer called saying they could not find a bank to finance the car with the person who had signed the loan documents and they needed a co-signer.  We looked at the contract that had been signed and it said nothing that allowed them to do this -- such as reserving the right to demand a co-signer (or in your case it would be to get you to take a different loan).  So I had the person tell them the contract he signed did not give them the right to ask for a co-signer after the fact.  Once he  told them that, they somehow found a bank to accept the original financing agreement with no co-signer.  If you search online for this kind of thing, you will see that it is a type of scam that car dealers pull on people and is actually not uncommon from what I've read.  If you feel you can understand the contract adequately, you can see what it says, or to be really safe, get an attorney to review it to see if there is any language that gives them the right to make you do what they are asking.  And if not, you can tell them so and you may get them to back down."

Do so by certified mail, return receipt requested, and keep a copy of the letter.  If two weeks goes by without compliance of either request, you can sue for damages and attorney fees.

1806375,"Don't worry! If your employer does not pay the prevailing wage upon you getting your green card, you can: 1. Quit your job and find a better paying one; and 2. No, no one will blame you for your employer's failure to keep his promise and take your hard earned, long awaited green card away.  All you need to do is preserve proof to have worked for that employer at least for a few weeks (or months) after having obtained your green card.  Pay stubs, W2 will go a long way to proving your having ""complied with your side of the bargain"" after obtaining the green card and having worked for the employer for a while, hoping that he would comply, and when finally realized that there was no hope anymore, you resigned and seeked greener pastures elsewhere. The law does not require you to continue working for the employer for an indefinite period or even for any definite period.  I once heard a CIS adjudicating officer in Los Angeles tell my client during a citizenship interview in a similar situation ""if you worked for even one day for the employer after having received your green card, then you complied with the law"" (and are OK).  When the time comes you will have much more than a few days of work with that employer to put down on your application for naturalization; don't worry!"

1948417,"Judging from your comments it sounds like the landlord kept your security deposit past 30 days without sending a 186 s15B-compliant letter (with invoices; signed under penalties of perjury; etc.)  I assume that the landlord has not yet returned all of your deposit.  If so, that is completely illegal. The landlord's action will result in automatic triple damages and attorneys fees, for the full amount which has not yet been returned to you. There is no functional defense if the law was not followed, as it is a strict liability statute. In fact, this is so obviously illegal that--at least in my experience--most of these cases are resolved through summary judgment or settlement, without ever going to court.    You would ordinarily sue both the individual and the trust and let them argue over who owes the money. But since the statute provides for attorneys fees, you'll find that you can usually get an attorney to help you."

1810040,"The Department of Justice has declared that advertising online casinos constitutes illegal aiding and abetting of gambling activity, if the gambling services are offered to U.S. citizens.  An affiliate relationship is a form of advertising, so there is a legal risk. The DOJ's legal position is somewhat untested, and there may be First Amendment concerns with criminalizing commercial speech.  However, many large advertisers, such as Google and Yahoo!, have paid millions of dollars in fines based on their previous advertisements of online casinos.  The fact that the wagering occurs in BitCoin is not likely to make any difference, since it is a form of 'property' according to the IRS, and a form of 'money' or 'currency' according to at least one federal court.  Any 'thing of value' can trigger gambling violations, under state laws."

1809628,"If the decedent died without a will, then the rightful heirs must be determined.  Your question does not state if the decedent left a spouse behind.  That spouse would also be an heir, in an intestate estate.  Also, it needs to be determined if there are any joint owners of the property with the decedent.  This could also effect title. You need to contact a probate attorney (with some real estate experience) to handle this for you.

First, whether his work is warrantied.  Also, whether he performed negligent repair or some other issue.  And, did you get written estimates prior to him commencing repair? Was he properly licensed by the State? Florida has a body of statutory law designed to protect consumers in instances like this.

1803410,"YES, the dispute would take one of several forms: 1) a third party prior art submission, done within 6 months of publication. See details at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1134.html 2) an inter partes re-examination after the patent issues. See details at http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/faqs_inter_partes_reexam.jsp That is basically like a mini-litigation and entail major expense, although less than civil litigation in Federal Court. 3) a civil declaratory judgment suit seeking to invalidate the patent in Federal Court. Expect that to cost upwards of $500K and more likely $3-5M if vigorously defended by the other side. 4) a derivation proceeding might be filed seeking to prove A disclosed to B before B filed. That is done at the US Pat. & TM Office and is very stacked against A due to the procedural rules that apparently do not include discovery of B's records by A. This is less expensive, likely, than inter partes re-exam or DJ suit, but still quite costly. Details can be reviewed here: http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/faqs_derivation_proceedings.jsp 5) you might file your own patent application with an affidavit under Rule 130 to show prior disclosure that invokes 35 USC 102(b) exceptions. You can read details here: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s717.html#ch700_d1ffd2_235c5_25d Note: your challenge is likely to be unsuccessful unless you not have an AIA-expert patent attorney/litigator managing the challenge, but also evidence and lots of money, both unlikely given that you are here seeking free advice. 6) If your challenge is successful, you will likely want to counterattack with a patent infringement suit or a misappropriation of trade secret suit or both. That, however, might be a multi-million dollar expense for both sides, which often leads to prompt settlement and that often cuts the expense dramatically. Having the right litigator is often key to successful challenge and to favorable settlement.  If you have the money and desire to challenge this, review the answers and pick the attorney that seems to know the most on the subject and about all the options available to you. It won't be cheap! Good legal representation never is cheap."

I believe are $277 for a name change, plus or minus, unless your family income level based on federal poverty guidelines would allow you to be eligible to file an affidavit of inability to pay costs, in which case the filing fees would be waived. Additionally you will need a copy of your SS card, a criminal history certificate of record search from the cops, recently taken fingerprints from either FAST or law enforcement, a copy of your birth certificate, and a sex offender registry search record.

1790540,"There are multiple topics invoked by your question.    First is whether a CSLB-licensed engineering contractor (""A"") may perform the same work as a CSLB-licensed general building (""B"") contractor.  If the project requires specialized knowledge and skill, or if the task being performed by the engineering contractor falls within the engineering contractor‰Ûªs license scope, the engineering contractor may perform under the A license.  See Ron Yates Constr. Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 337, 348 and Pacific Caisson & Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 681, 691.     Second, the lack of a written contract presents a problem for the contractor if the job is a home improvement project.  California Business & Professions Code section 7159 requires written contracts between homeowners and contractors containing disclosures and many specified terms, and is applicable to all but very sophisticated homeowners.    Third, it is highly improper and potentially illegal for a person to threaten to report the contractor to the government in an effort to exact unpaid change orders.  When a threat to report a crime or unfavorable information to the government is coupled with a demand for payment or services, it may constitute extortion as defined by California Penal Code 519.    The contractor‰Ûªs best strategy will be guided by the precise facts of the case beyond what is described in the question above.  Depending upon the facts the contractor could be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties for contracting outside his license classification.

1788432,"People can maintain their house as they would like.  However, if their lack of maintenance masks problems that become apparent later, the new owners can come back to the prior owners, including you, for relief.  That being said, seems you need to get back in touch with your family law attorney to see if the court will order her to perform maintenance of the still-joint asset, or force her to allow you to conduct certain maintenance activities.  Occupants may not commit ""waste"" to a property.  Improper maintenance of a jointly held property can be considered ""waste"" of the investment value.  However, you need a court - here a family court - to declare that your ex is committing ""waste.""  Good luck."

The real issue for you may be what happens if 30 days comes and goes - without the contractor vacating...while ""self-help"" is legally available to commercial landlords (like locking the contractor out; having a lien upon their property still on the rental site for any sums still owed by the contractor to the landlord; etc., they are still disfavored and cannot be applied if doing so disturbs the peace, etc.  You may well wish to have a commercial landlord-tenant attorney at least review, if not handle, the matter for you.  If you slip up or otherwise err, you may well face a lawsuit back at you seeking lost profits and other damages.

Had the case been dismissed or otherwise dropped, the defendant may have been eligible to expunge the arrest and court records, if the defendant otherwise qualified.    If the case would have been reduced to a burglary of a structure, and adjudication was withheld, the defendant would have been able to seal the arrest and court records if he otherwise qualified.

If you had been in CA for less than the past 2 years, you would need to apply the 180-day prior rule to see which state's exemptions apply.  There is another, more rare bankruptcy code section that you might want to be aware of: section(s) 522(o),(p), (q), etc. which might limit the homestead exemption to $155,675; However, I believe there is case law that may make that inapplicable.

1812751,"This question cannot be answered without a review of the contract and the addendum deadline agreement. This question is not one for the employment/labor lawyers and I will repost it for the lawyers who handle contract disputes.  Where a deadline is specified in the contract, you have a right to expect that the job will be completed by that date. As one court ruled some years ago, the conduct of the parties, while a delay continues, may be such as to indicate a purpose to  keep the contract alive; and such a purpose, once manifested, may not be suddenly abandoned. So, here you say that since the demolition in March there has been no other work.  If you did not provide the contractor with warnings that the work was advancing too slowly, that you were dissatisfied, and a demand to hasten the pace of the job,  you may not be able to tell him now (given the problem with the cabinets that was beyond the contractor's control) to stop work. In other words you may not be able to recscind the contract based on delays which you did not protest, and demand the return of all money paid to date. These cases are fact specific and the language of the contract is of paramount importance. Good luck to you."

If you and your husband are currently separated, you can go to your local domestic relations office and file for spousal support.   This will give you some income so you can consult with an attorney. Unfortunately, Legal Aid does not usually do divorces in Southeastern Pennsylvania.  You can, also, try one of the local law schools, like Temple, Penn, or Drexel to see if they have a clinic that helps people with divorce.  If you cannot get any legal help, you can go to the website of the county in which you live and find the forms that you need to file yourself.

Sadly things can break down when you are forced to pick a school district if you both don't live in the same one.  Having an Order helps take care of a lot of issues and might be a good idea to work on one when you are both still getting along for the most part.  You might also think about contacting a mediator, like the Rural Law Center in Massena, to help you both communicate and work out a resolution which could then be picked up and put into an Order that hopefully you could both live with.

Was opposing counsel and/or his client present in Court on the day of the ex parte?  If so, did the father represent that he was available to attend?"
1031363,"I concur with the attorney answers below. Virtual offices can be a very effective means of growing your business. Provided you decide to move forward with a virtual office, here are  some considerations for you prior to contract signature: First, meet with the office manager (not the sales person) and the  receptionists. Determine if you trust these people. Their competence and conscientiousness in delivery of services will  allow your business to grow. Scour your virtual office contract and ask many questions. Interlineate with changes and signatures from both you and the virtual  office provider's representive if necessary. Clear up any vague language in the contract, get it in writing with a  signature as well. A few things to ask your virtual office provider: Once the contract is up, am I required to pay additional fees if I am  no longer using a virtual office here (mail forwarding...)? Do you anticipate any additional charges that I may not be aware of?  If the answer is no, get it in writing. If you wish to use the mail forwarding service, ask how frequently the  mail will be forwarded. Assess the frequency with your business needs. Ask about long distance charges. For example, if your virtual office  is located in the 415 area code and calls are forwarded to your home  number in the 510 area code, you'll likely incur long distance fees. Finally, virtual offices often provide a business with a local telephone  number. If you were to end the virtual office contract what would  happen to that number? If the answer is ""lost for all eternity"", plan  to retain your existing business number. Have an exit strategy. The assumption here is your business will be so  successful that one day you will outgrow this facility. Best of luck  to you in that regard."

A parent cannot simply ""send"" a child to a detention center. Normally, a child is only detained in that type of setting if they are accused of committing a serious criminal act. A child who is running away might be placed in a treatment facility, if the child is in need of mental health treatment. Either of these situations would involve a process, with a hearing in Juvenile Court.   2. You could be in trouble if you are found to be breaking the custody order.

1810189,"Attorneys Goldstein and Raddatz are correct in their answers.  There is no mechanism for your having the father's parental rights terminated except if you are doing so thru an adoption proceeding.  In an adoption, you and your partner, spouse or fiancÌ© would file a Petition for Adoption and ask that the court terminate the father's parental rights in favpr of your new partner.  The biological father would have to be given notice of the adoption proceedings.  If he consents to the adoption, his rights will be terminated and if he does not consent, his rights could still be terminated on the basis of his unfitness.  You would have to present proof to the court and if the court agrees, then his rights would be terminated by the court.    If you are considering adoption, you should consult with an attorney who is well versed in adoption law and procedure.  Many attorneys, including me, offer a free consultation for such matters."

This is done by asking both parents to provide information sufficient to run support calculations.  That being said, if you are paying support, you must immediately begin paying such support to the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) NOT Mother.  Every dime of support that you pay Mother after she goes on welfare (TANF) may not be credited to you, especially if DCSS has served you with notice that payment of support is supposed to go to them.  As for modifying the support, if you wait until the court hearing to supply the Court with your information, you will likely end up with a continuance of the hearing.  If you send the documents with your current information (which would include your temporary income), DCSS will run support calculations based on that income and submit their findings to the Court.    It is your call whether you want to wait until there is a court date set for child support to supply any information to the Court and DCSS or  do so now.   However, remember that DCSS is a governmental collection agency that does not have your best interest at heart.  Their interest is in protecting the public interest.  They do not represent Mother and they do not represent the child.  Good luck."

If the Judge said that some exhibits were submitted at the Hearing but they haven't been ""scanned"" into the Board file yet, yes that does happen.

1842655,"Your question is two fold.   1.  You need not an employment attorney, but a CPA to advise you on how to cut the check, how much taxes to deduct, etc.  That's the job of a CPA or a tax attorney.  For this small a project, a CPA familiar with this type of employment should be sufficient.  2.    You need a real estate attorney to draft this contract for you.  Even though it is an employment contract, those who do this often either know the employment issues or consult with an employment attorney on their team.  The main issue here is that that there is no such thing as ""ceremonial"" when it comes to risk management and protecting yourself against lawsuits and discharging your duties under the law as a landlord.  If you know all that the manager needs to do, and you can do it yourself, you may be home free.  Otherwise, you need to hire someone who will help you fulfill your obligations.  And adding another layer of complexity is that certain laws apply to the conduct of property managers. So, if you hire someone who is a novice or a straw man, you may be potentially setting yourself up for liability.  Again, I do not have enough facts regarding your level of expertise.  But assuming you are a sophisticated landlord, I don't advise going down that road.  Sorry if the answer is not as cut and dried or great news.  But in today's litigious society, it helps to be aware of what laws apply to your conduct and/or hire an expert to advise you.  I've seen way too many lawsuits filed against small landlords who didn't know what they were doing, but were preventable, to counsel you otherwise.  Good luck."

1850424,"Asker, I would not be concerned about this issue, during the adjudication phase of your claim the VA assessed your level of disability by considering the level of symptomology related to the service connected TBI (I'm going to assume for simplicity under the diagnostic codes for an acquired mental health disorder).  In almost all cases, that will continue in unless the evidence demonstrates a clear material improvement in the level of disability.  In the broader sense (for example, a veteran with a S/C depressive condition and a non-service connected Alzheimer's disease), the VA can attempt separate the symptoms related to the service connected disability versus the non-service connected disability.  In practice, I rarely see this done for mental health disorders."

Once a doctor or institution can be shown to have practiced in a manner below the expected standard for his/its specialty , then damages have to be established and causally connected to the alleged negligence.    best of luck,   Doc Shah   Zaheer A.

1789054,"The Executor has a fiduciary obligation to act fairly and in the best interest of all beneficiaries, even if he does not like a beneficiary.  The Court will have supervision over the actions of the Executor, so you will not be treated unfairly.  The Executor can also secure the estate assets, such as the personal effects.  I am aware that sometimes someone shows up and takes valuable assets when they do not have the authority, and it is hard to prove.  This would be unfair to the other beneficiaries.  Anything you gave your parents are part of their estate.  Your taking back of what you gave them, might be unfair to the other beneficiaries.  If the Executor is good, he will figure out a fair way to distribute the personal effects.  Regarding the loan, the Executor would have to have some proof that it was a loan and not a gift.  So, if he has a Promissory Note, or reference in the Will that your inheritance is to be reduced by the unpaid balance of the loan, then your inheritance can be reduced.  However, if there is no documentation, and your parents never enforced the repayment, then I think the Executor is not in a good position to enforce it."
1807872,"A good answer to your specific situation will require a review of the relevant documents and facts. Generally speaking, the lack of the husband's signature will probably not void the contract.  It may prevent him from suing, but probably not, and should not prevent the wife from suing.  Practically speaking, if they are still married, then it would not really matter. Contact a local attorney for more specific information."
1829044,"A court can waive the 60 day requirement depending on the following (1) Did your ex sign a waiver and did the ex sign the divorce; (2) Why are you leaving the country? (3) How long are you leaving; (4) Can your ex do the offer of proof for you? If for some reason or another you leave the country before finalizing the divorce, and your case has been inactive for about 18 months, then your case will get administratively dismissed."
1330836,"You can find out if his lawyer was licensed in Illinois via the Illinois ARDC website (I've attached the link), but it is highly unlikely that it would be a factor in your brother's appeal for at least two reasons.  First, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, the immigration court is federal and does not require that attorneys be locally licensed as long as they are licensed in some state.  Second, attorney errors or misdeeds are not grounds for an appeal unless they affected the outcome of the case.  If the outcome of the case was affected by something the lawyer did or did not do, then it's not going to matter where they were licensed because the error itself is going to be the basis of the appeal.    Your brother should hire an attorney to review the record of the proceedings and identify the issues on which to base the appeal.  Remember that the appeal has to be RECEIVED by the BIA within 30 days of the decision.  Good luck!"
1793084,"This is from the Florida Statutes - The court may modify an order of support, maintenance, or alimony by increasing or decreasing the support, maintenance, or alimony retroactively to the date of the filing of the action or supplemental action for modification as equity requires, giving due regard to the changed circumstances or the financial ability of the parties or the child.  The basis for a modification of child support in Florida is a substantial change of circumstances since the entry of the last order addressing child support. The change needs to be involuntary and permanent in nature.   There isn't a simple yes or no answer to your questions.  There are other factors that need to be considered. You should contact a local attorney for a full analysis.   Kendra Stephen | Supra Legal Group | Tel: 954-900-9709"
1802473,"It is more complicated than a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. If DCS is involved in the case and they chose to remove the child, the Department generally has to create a plan of care (Permanency Plan) for the parent to follow. Part of that plan requires DCS to provide services to the parent to assist the parent in getting the child back. If the parent doesn't cooperate with the plan, DCS could then file a termination of parental rights.  Sometimes, DCS can ask the court to waive the requirement to provide ""reasonable efforts"" to help the parent if the abuse of the child was severe. In that case, DCS could file a petition to terminate once they were given custody after an adjudicatory hearing.  If the child in in the care of someone else, that person could file a petition for temination and adoption.  In any of those situations you would have the right to an attorney if you cannot afford one, so if that situation arises be sure to ask for an attorney."
1820669,"You may have a viable claim but will almost certainly need to hire an expert witness, which can be expensive. I suggest you consult with an attorney and start with a demand letter with a view to settling the dispute rather than litigating it. Do you have proof of misdiagnosis? The vet might say that the diagnostic tests were necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Again, I suggest you consult with an experienced litigator.

1797743,"What information they collect and require will depend on them. Some organizations keep detailed information on volunteers, others may not keep more than sign in sheets. The nature of what you plan to do as a volunteer may also come into play. Volunteer firefighters that I have known were covered by fire company provided insurance for certain things, such as life insurance or workers compensation, which would require a lot of information, but people who just wanted to help at events did not need to worry about that. Unfortunately, the nature of your disability may affect whether or not you are capable of performing the duties of what you want to volunteer for. Helping at fundraisers, like bingo, or washing trucks will have far different requirements than carrying a charged fire hose or cutting open a crashed car to rescue the occupants. You may just need to contact the Chief and ask what the process is to volunteer, and see if there are volunteer tasks available within any limitations you may have."

If the chokehold continues, then you may need to do whatever you feel is needed to protect yourself.  In the end it's your word vs the officer's as to what happened.

Even though CA is a two party consent state (which means you can not audio record someone without their consent), that statute actually applies to conversations in which there is a privacy expectation--contrary to popular belief, it does not apply in public areas, because nobody has a legal expectation of privacy when they are in public. However, your apartment complex may have its own rules on cameras on exteriors of units. So you may want to check. You may want to consider hiring a lawyer to send legal correspondence to whomever is making you feel threatened, and the lawyer can also advise if you have enough for a restraining order. The lawyer can also send legal correspondence to the landlord if rules on smoking are being broken and its affecting your quality of living there."

1791100,"Texas is a community property state. Like California, New Mexico, Arizona and other states that follow community property law, the community is responsible for all debts incurred by one spouse either before or during the marriage.  However, once you divorce, debts incurred in the individual person's capacity as an individual are generally presumed to be his or her own. The exception is debt for necessaries (rent, food, medical bills, and the like) or other debts incurred for the benefit of the marital community.  The divorce decree usually divides debts, but if its silent on that point, personal debts are personal to the individual; community debts are joint debts.  That said, once you divorce, your individual debts are your own.  Now sometimes those debts can stick to community property that became separate property as a result of the divorce decree, but that is another story entirely."
1820418,"I agree with the previous comment.  Courts cannot make decisions if they do not have the authority to do so.   A ""MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES"" is just the argument backed up with legal authorities -- in other words, laws and court rules and decisions from other court cases -- that give this particular court the right to do whatever it is you are asking in your motion."
1826827,"While I can't agree with the legal substance of the officer's claim that they are unable to act on the matter without having personally observed the offense, the statement seems to indicate that they are not going to do anything. The fact that you were encouraged to leave the store before the arrival of police makes the filing of a Private Criminal Complaint seem likewise remote. The only thing you can do now is wait to see if the charge is filed. I would highly recommend that you not get stressed out while waiting. Relax and seek suitable representation if you receive a Criminal Summons in the mail."

1814598,"They can refuse but without any money, they would dealer be hard pressed to enforce the contract unless they sue you.  However, keep in mid that whatever verbal negotiations you conducted would be overridden by the writing.

Bring the car back to the dealership and tell them you are cancelling the deal.  If the y give you any trouble, contact a consumer debt attorney as well as the AG and  the BBB.  The dealer will not want the negative publicity and investigation."

1806703,"The probate attorney's duties are to assist the personal representative in the administration of the estate. That includes filing all the necessary documents with the court and advising the PR as to their next steps.  Mostly, it is a matter of contract between the PR and attorney.  The PR has a long list of duties to perform in the administration of an estate and they can negotiate to have some or all of those done by their attorney - but, it will cost more to have the attorney do the PR's job.  The attorney is the legal advisor to the PR - not the PR.  The Florida Bar website has a wonderful pamphlet, as mentioned by Attorney Elder, that discusses the duties of the PR. It would be good to read that so you know what to expect of your attorney and what tasks you are responsible for taking on yourself."

After you are served with a summons and complaint, it takes a minimum of 45 days to get a judgment against you.  After the judgment is entered, the creditor can begin wage garnishment IF the creditor knows where you work.  Based upon the time line I just described, if you still have time, then it will not hurt to contact the creditor to try to make payment arrangements.  If I answered your question, then please mark my answer as helpful. Thanks."
1792187,"First, the good news: it is by no means certain that you will go to prison.  That being said, your actions from now on can have a substantial impact on the outcome of this case.  You should not talk about this online and you should certainly not discuss it with police or anyone other than a lawyer.  This is a very serious charge and you should contact and hire an attorney as soon as possible.    Now the bad news: Assault II is a ballot measure 11 offense, meaning that, if convicted, you could receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 70 months in prison.  A good criminal defense attorney, however, could talk to you about possible defenses to the charge and mitigating evidence.  Even at this early stage, without having been charged, an attorney can contact witnesses, law enforcement, and the prosecutor to discuss your case and attempt to prevent charges from being filed.    Finally, without knowing more, no lawyer can tell you whether you will go to prison for this incident or what the officer was thinking when he elected not to arrest you.  A good lawyer, however, will begin working immediately to do everything possible to prevent you from going to prison."
1818612,"Under Washington state law, you are probably not covered under Workers' Compensation. The Industrial Insurance Act provides for workers' compensation benefits to: :""each worker receiving an injury, . . . during the course of his or her employment . . . while on the jobsite. The jobsite shall consist of the premises as are occupied, used or contracted for by the employer for the business or work process in which the employer is then engaged. RCW 51.32.015 and RCW 51.36.040. The Act also defines when a worker is ""acting in the course of employment."" RCW 51.08.013(1) provides:       ""Acting in the course of employment"" means the worker acting at his or her employer's direction or in the furtherance of his or her employer's business which shall include time spent going to and from work on the jobsite, as defined in RCW 51.32.015 and 51.36.040, insofar as such time is immediate to the actual time that the worker is engaged in the work process in areas controlled by his or her employer, except parking area. It is not necessary that at the time an injury is sustained by a worker he or she is doing the work on which his or her compensation is based.""  Feel free to call a workers compensation lawyer to discuss more fully. If the curb in the parking lot was an odd height, or there was some other hazard, you may have a claim against the owner of the lot. You can certainly investigate this as well. Good luck!"
1810728,"It's a very rare case where prosecutors ask the judge to deviate from a PSI's recommendations and even rarer when judges actually do so.  However, if you have an attorney you need to review the PSI with them and go over your sentencing arguments and options beforehand."

If it's spousal, then you need to take your divorce decree and separation agreement to a lawyer and have them look at it. You will need a lawyer to do the modification through the correct court, if the decree does allow for a modification of spousal support."
1809338,"No, applying for a loan is not a means based, public benefit and cannot result in a finding that one is a public charge."
1820702,"I have to diverge slightly from my colleague's view.  I agree there is no black letter confidentiality duty that applies to landlords.  However, at least here in Oregon, court's have held that there is a fiduciary and/or ""special"" duty between landlords and tenants and while I have not seen that applied in a confidentiality context, depending upon the exact facts, it might at least open the door to such an argument.  The other possibility that comes to mind depends upon exactly what is being revealed.  Management companies/managers have been held to be subject to and liable under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and are likely to be subject to the California version as well.  If the manager is complaining to others about debts, such as rent, that he alleges you owe, there might be some violations there that would be actionable.  If so, and you won, you would be entitled to not only your damages but also your court costs and attorneys fees.  Doesn't get you out of the lease per se but they are very likely in my opinion to be willing to let you out of the lease as part of a settlement of such a lawsuit if you otherwise had likely grounds of winning.  Good luck."

1808131,"You should have a discussion with your attorney about this, assuming that you've hired one.  The rule putting the attorney's fee high on the list of creditors to be paid is a rule that governs PRIORITY of payment, not necessarily the ORDER of payment.  I don't imagine you have to worry about the attorney coming back and demanding more money if his/her fee is collected early on without some extraordinary turn of events that significantly increases the amount of work to be done.  Also, an increase in the assets that are available, if more are discovered, could increase the attorney's."

1798623,"I don't know the specifics of the case, but I would think you should return to court to enforce the order/agreement.  Keep in mind, some municipalities protect tenants (such as Chicago) with strong ordinances, so make sure you as landlord have followed rules exactly.    It seems that if they are not paying and were ordered to pay, you should be able to get possession under the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act."

1827079,"First of all, what type of lawsuit is it?  Some lawsuits are permitted service by tack and post or by leaving it in the manner you described, but more than likely, the service was not proper.  There is no such thing as trespass in this situation or violation of privacy as the contents of a complaint is a matter of public record. therefore anyone can obtain a copy and read the contents.  The service issues make service of process most likely void but it is not absolute."
1808270,"If it was part of a Court order, the court that issued it would have a copy on file.  If you cannot get in touch with the lawyer, call the Board of Bar Overseers at (617) 728-8700  and they will know what happened to the lawyer and possibly how to get in touch with him."
1825178,"Rule 35 is typically a motion to either reduce a sentence under subpart (a), due to some mitigating circumstance or overlooked circumstances. Under subpart (a), the Court is the only movant that can reduce the sentence.  Subpart (b) which is typically the part that is addressed, can only be filed on motion by the Assistant US Attorney on behalf of the Government. It is typically brought on for reasons of substantial assistance.   You do not have to personally be in court unless you're needed to testify.  Typically your attorney, or the AUSA will be present.  I've been totally out of the federal crimlaw scene for many, many years, but my suggestion to you is that you go offline and talk to your lawyer about the details. I say this because if you're presently incarcerated, there's a substantial risk that your personal safety will be compromised.  And if you are not incarcerated, you DO NOT want to be in a public forum like a court, where you will definitely be identifiable in the event whoever it is you offered substantial assistance against, determines that you happen to be the CI."

1807147,"I agree with both of the attorneys who have previously posted. You have a few options. First, if he gave you a 3-Day Notice to Pay or Surrender Possession asking for rent for the next three weeks, he cannot evict you for non-payment of rent if you normally pay on the first of the month and you are currently paid up to date. He has the right to give you notice that you must vacate the property, however, that notice must be made at least 15 days prior to the beginning of a new month, in your case. So even if he gave you a 15 day notice to vacate the premises, it would not take effect until August 31st.   I would highly suggest calling a Landlord/Tenant attorney in your area for more information."
1806065,"Short Answer - Yes.   This type of demand happens many times with stores like Walmart. A person is arrested for retail theft. They have a criminal court hearing etc and perhaps are found guilty/not guilty.   Then a civil demand letter shows up in the mail either while they are waiting for the criminal case or after the criminal case is over.   This letter is very serious!   It is usually a demand to pay some small amount $160 ish to $260 ish dollars for them to agreed to forego a civil lawsuit. The letter usually cites the particular statute in question.  The catch is, this specific statute does exist and does mention the fine amount specifically!  So i suggest taking the letter to an attorney who handles shoplifting/retain theft cases and consult with them on the civil side. You will probably find it is cheaper to pay the civil demand amount to skip the civil case. Unfortunate, but realistic.   Don't ignore the letter or it could get worse for you.   Now, how does it affect your credit?  If the civil demand actually becomes a civil case, and you end up losing and getting a money judgement against you, it ends up in the state databases showing you have a judgement against you.   The credit reporting agencies scour these databases and upload the judgment information in their databases. Then they cross reference with know factors such as your name, address, phone number and birthdate.   Then, magically, the judgement is now on your credit report and affecting your credit score!  The problem is, there is no regular reporting method to remove a judgement. Credit care companies regularly report updates to the credit agencies. This update affects you account ongoing. There is no such type of update in the civil judgment systems. So if it shows up on your credit report you have to basically prove you paid it off (separately - this is done with a filing of a satisfaction of judgement with the court after payment in full) by showing your filed satisfaction of judgement. And the worst part is, they simply update the database to show the judgement paid off, it still stays as a previous debt for years (it is not removed, simply updated to reflect a zero balance). So the harm to your credit report goes on and on and on.   So take the criminal charges seriously (try to fight and get it reduced or removed) and the civil demand letter seriously and consult with an attorney right away.   Hopefully this helps!"

1815718,"Two things: 1)  you should have known prior to the hearing how much it would cost to add your child to your insurance and then presented this evidence to the judge.  This amount would then have been factored into the child support calculation. 2) Cash medical support is ordered in cases where there is not some court order that addresses how the after-insurance/uninsured health care costs are to be divided between the parents.  If there was such a court order (e.g. a prior divorce judgment may contain such language) then you should have presented this evidence to the judge.  It sounds like child support may have been established through an administrative hearing and perhaps there are no other court orders between you and the other parent.  You may want to consider initiating a proceeding to establish a parenting plan (the amount of time you have affects the child support calculation), and to provide for a 50/50 division of uninsured health care costs, and to also modify child support/cash medical, based on these new factors.  Through this process you should be able to modify child support and eliminate cash medical, but there are some pitfalls and you should schedule a consultation with an experienced family law attorney to gain a better understanding of how all this works."
1812420,"Since you are in Scottsdale, you can make an appointment via INFOPASS for the USCIS office in Phoenix.  I have seen them issuing a temporary I-551 stamp on the passport for travel and other reasons following the filing of the I-751.  However, US officers are hesitant (and sometimes outright relunctant) to issue I-551 stamps and you have to be prepared to convince them that you need it, and why the normal receipt extending your status for a year is not sufficient. And don't be surprised if they won't do it.  Good luck.  Jared"

1992002,"You should ask your question to your attorney. After all, that is why you hired him or her. I generally have settlement checks issued in both my firm's name and the client's name.

2257104,There is no such thing as a lawyer with connections inside the asylum office pushing things through. My client has also been waiting since 2013 for his interview results. USCIS does not have to speed things up they do not have to help you. Immigrants have privileges not rights. You cannot force them to do anything.  Why didn't you hire an attorney?  If you contact the office all they will tell you is that your case is pending and you will receive a decision through the mail.
1810917,Now that the party that caused the accident died the claim would be against the at fault party's estate rather them him personally. Hopefully there is insurance coverage in which case the insurance company for the at fault party would be responsible for paying any settlement or verdict.
1801713,"Work with an attorney -- you can probably handle the in-court stuff yourself, but work with a lawyer to get the papers drawn up properly.   Once they're signed you can get things done in court to schedule your date to make your presentation to the judge.  The lawyer can help you with that, as well."
1791604,Possibly. It is entirely up to the judge whether or not he will accept a plea under First Offender. Your case sounds like a good First Offender possibility. There may be better options available to you such as diversion.
1782701,"Typically, experts' calendars are pretty busy so that they are only available on certain dates. Therefore, you can object to the Notices of Depositions on the ground that  the deposition date had not been coordinated with you, your counsel or your expert(s) prior to sending out the notice so there is now a calendar conflict. Furthermore, depending on what stage in litigation you are in, you may or may not be able to do the inspection. Usually, in state court, any discovery (other than expert discovery) cuts off 30 days before trial. It seems like you are involved in a complex litigation case. If you are not represented, you are definitely better off retaining counsel."
1829245,"When you file for bankruptcy, a law called the automatic stay comes into effect, protecting you from collection efforts, including lawsuits.  It's not a response to the collection lawsuit, as such, but it means that you do not need to respond - they cannot continue their lawsuit.  That being said, deciding whether you should file for bankruptcy takes an analysis of your entire financial picture.  I would highly recommend that you set up a consultation with one or more bankruptcy attorneys to discuss your options.  Many of us offer free consultations.  Best of luck."
1238160,"I handle cases at 346 Broadway almost every day. The biggest advantage of retaining a private lawyer is that I come to court so that you don't have to take the day off work, wait in line for possibly several hours and be unable to use your smart phone to communicate with your business needs. Because the case is on for resolution and not trial, there is no benefit to you appearing in court as you will not be afforded the opportunity to speak on your own behalf.  The large majority of my clients are busy, employed white-collar individuals who appreciate being spared the indignity of spending a full day at 346 Broadway.  If you need further assistance, please contact me directly."
1814369,"We get this question a lot. Age of consent in NC is 16. HOWEVER, when a minor gets pregnant, her parents can cause a world of problems for the father. When you are a minor, your parents still have the legal right to run your life. They can demand you stay away from the older male and that he stay away from you. They can cause custody trouble. So, as Mr. Finnecy advises, use birth control if you are going to have a sexual relationship. Just because its legal to have sex does not mean there won't be consequences. Please consider this...true love can and does wait. The best thing to do is to wait. A man who loves you will agree. A man who doesn't agree, doesn't love you."
1793978,"If he has told lies about you within the last year that are harmful to your reputation, you may have a civil case against him for defamation.

I wish you the best of luck in finding the justice you deserve."

2164090,"I a very sorry for your loss.  The first step if you believe your sister was the victim of negligence is to retain a lawyer.    In order to pursue any medical negligence case it is necessary to show a deviation from the standard of care--basically meaning the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is how similarly qualified practitioners would have managed the patient's care under the same or similar circumstances. In order to find out if you were the victim of negligence, you need to retain a lawyer willing to investigate the claim. The lawyer will gather your medical records and have them reviewed by a medical expert who will be asked to offer an opinion as to whether 1. the care and treatment you received fell below the applicable standard of care and 2. caused an injury. There is no claim to pursue unless and until such an opinion is secured."
2040375,"It depends on how the restraining order is worded. Defendant's often use third parties to do their dirty work when a retraining order has been issued against them. That is why some, but not all, retraining orders ban the defendant from using third parties to contact the other party, follow that person, photograph them, etc... I would report the activity to the police department and make sure the incidents are documented. You can also apply for a retaining order against these third parties for their creepy and disturbing actions. If you are fearful of these third parties and want them to stay away from you, your children, and their school(s), go to the court and apply for a retaining order against that person. This new ""significant other"" of your ex, needs to be addressed by you in a legal manner, as soon as possible. If you do not, the nonsense will escalate and you will be further tested by your ex and the new ""friend"". Good Luck"

1806903,"The agreement for the cell service is not between Friend 1 and Friend 2. What Friend 2 knew about Friend 1's mental capacity is not relevant to whether the contract is enforceable between Friend 1 and service provider.  It would be very difficult to void the contract between Friend 1 and service provider. To void the contract, Friend 1 would have to prove that Friend 1 was mental incapable and that service provider knew of Friend 1's mental incapacity. How would the service provider know that Friend 1 had taken narcotics?  Hiring an attorney likely will cost Friend 1 more in attorney's fees than just paying termination fees.  Friend 1 likely has no legal duty to provide cell phone service to Friend 2. Friend 1 can just terminate the phone service (and paying the termination fees) or switch the service to another phone that Friend 1 has control of."
1806437,Usually if a tape is available it will be reviewed - if you did nothing wrong why are you concerned - t might prove helpful to the proof of your claim as soon as it is timely preserved.

1817934,"All you have to do is send a fax to that number stating you submit on the tentative.   You may want to show up in case the other side shows up to argue.   So in letter form you need to include the hearing date the name of the case and case number.  The ruling is attentive because if the other side shows up to argue, the court may change its' mind.  Not likely, but possible."
1823914,"You can always conduct business, but you may be investing in a trademark that you will not be able to own or control and you may be forced to change your name/branding/etc.  However, just because the application has been suspended, that doesn't mean that there is nothing you can do because there are many options.   You can still respond to the suspension and argue the likelihood of confusion issue.  If the dates of use and timing are right, you may also file an Opposition Proceeding to challenge the other trademark. You could also consider a Concurrent Use Proceeding.  Each of these options require an attorney with significant knowledge of trademark practice so you should select a competent attorney to help you decide the best way to move forward with your trademark.  Good luck."
1805533,"No. 1 - Don't violate your probation - now that you have violated and have a Motion to Revoke filed - you need to get a lawyer in whatever county your probation is in. Most judges want you to complete thier probation instead of sending you to jail, so you are probably good.  No. 2 - try to work it out with your probation officer - if you can't - then talk to there supervisor and ask for a different officer."
1788580,"Since your husband's check should be directly deposited into his account, I do not know why his employer would hold his check.  This is a question for the employer.  Many states regulate the reasons an employer can withhold funds from their employees and I do not anticipate incarceration alone, when there is the ability to directly deposit the funds, as a reason to withhold pay."
1817791,"Actually, Illinois statutes do not require witnesses to a marriage ceremony.  The only county that has a witness requirement is DuPage, which requires two witnesses.  So, if you want someone to watch through the internet, fine."
1793044,"Hire an attorney to handle this for you.  While it appears the DA has decided not to file a case, the DA has up to one year from the date of the incident to file (a misdemeanor) or generally three years to file (a felony).

1827637,"The wife's income is not taken into consideration in calculating the standard child support calculation.  It can be taken into consideration in determining whether to deviate from the support schedule.  If your ex-spouse is claiming to devote his time to working at his new wife's business and not getting paid, a good argument can be made that he is voluntarily under employed and the court can impute income to him.   You need to speak with a family law lawyer.  I believe discovery will be needed as well."
1798283,"I have no idea what ""the meeting"" means.  If you are a wage earner or salaried, the employer can establish pay periods.  Once they are established, the employers is bound to pay on the benchmark dates.  If you are being paid piecework or by the ""meeting"" or are an outside contractor, the rules are a little different.  Your question simply lacks enough detail to address.  The IDOL PROCESS TAKES ABOUT TWO YEARS, SO THATS NO REMEDY FOR PAY A WEEK LATE..  If you want to describe your arrangement, Ill check back and see if I can help."
1798084,"Is there a reason why there is such a big window of time for your ex to call your daughter?  Maybe you can suggest a specific window  of time that you will make your daughter available for her mother's telephone call [e.g., between 6 and 7:00 p.m.) or have your daughter contact her mom at an agreed upon time.  This would hopefully resolve the problem.  However, if she refuses and continues to contact the police, you may want to consult with an attorney to see whether it is worth filing a Request for Order to modify the Court order to either establish a window of time for the telephone calls and/or eliminate the telephone calls to avoid this problem."
1796222,"If you do not have sufficient work credits to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) there is a limit on assets and income for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSDI is an entitlement program that you earn an insured status for if you work, pay Social Security Taxes on your earnings, and become disabled while you still have sufficient work credits. Generally if you have worked and earned more than $5,000 in at least 5 of the last 10 years before becoming disabled, you meet the non-medical requirements for SSDI and you can qualify for benefits if you can prove that you Disabilty prevents you from working full-time. To determine if you meet the non-medical requirements of SSDI, obtain a Social Security Statement from Social Security's website by creating a My Social Security Online Account, or contact SSA and ask if you have enough credits to qualify for SSDI and ask for your Date Last Insured.   If you don't qualify for SSDI, SSI would consider your assets (the money in your bank account) before looking at whether you are medically disabled. As a single person, if you have more than $2,000 in assets you do not even qualify to apply. If your are married SSA looks at whether you have more than $3,000 in assets between you and your spouse. You are also disqualified, or only entitled to a reduce payment if you have any income from any source, and if you are married, all income from your spouse is also considered.    I would recommend that you contact an attorney or Social Security immediate to determine if you qualify for Disabilty benefits."
1824565,"While many creditors will let things go after they are paid off, some credit unions seem to have nothing better to do than to make sure you pay the maximum penalty for a little mistake.  Good credit should not rely on one issue, and you need to stop worrying about this one transaction and begin to build positive credit other ways so that this single negative will be buried by more recent information.  I published a 10 part series about credit rebuilding after bankruptcy that could be useful to you, but you will need to scroll past a lot of info that may not interest you to find these articles.  The link to my guides is below.  Hope this perspective helps!"
1823615,"If you and your husband hold title to the house as Tenants by the Entirety, probably not. If you hold title to the house as Joint Tenants or Tenants in Common, probably yes. You should talk to a lawyer to look over the deed to your house and the judgement let you know for sure. This type of legal review can be done fairly cheaply, so do not let the perceived cost of an attorney discourage you."
1788536,"Habitual lateness can be considered a material breach of the lease that justifies a finding of eviction. I think you need more than just two months of lateness to reach the level needed to evict.  A magistrate or arbitration panel here in Allegheny County wouldn't likely evict unless the tenant was substantially late every month for perhaps 5 or 6months. And you still might not get possession if the magistrate or arbitration panel sympathizes with the tenant, who always manages to pay. I wouldn't likely try it if I were you at this point and I likely wouldn't try it in the winter, either, when it is harder to identify a tenant. I do hope you have a late fee provision in your lease which you are enforcing."
1826781,"There's not enough information presented here but if it's pretrial supervision, they typically don't violate for a first-time positive urine screen.  However, you can expect to have their attention and you may be referred to other treatment if it happens again.  Good luck."
1798465,"Of course, anything can happen, if attorney objects and attacks the NTA and requests that the judge terminate the removal proceedings. If the immigration judge will deem the attorney's objections and attack of the NTA meritorious, the Judge will agree to terminate on the first master calendar hearing."
1816245,"Under the rules of professional conduct you are only to pay one attorney fee. Meaning, if you had two lawyers and a 40% contingency agreement, your two lawyers are to be paid out of that 40%.  So, if your second lawyer knew about the lien before the distribution of funds, and he paid himself the full contingency, then he broke the law. It is that simple. He should have paid the first lawyer from his share of the contingency fee. The State Bar will not like this if a report were to be filed.   If however, the second lawyer did not pay himself the full contingency and the $100k represents the balance of the fee, it is not yours to claim. The two lawyers will sort out who gets what.   If the money is indeed in excess of the agreed upon contingency (40%) then the State Bar will investigate the case at no charge to you."
1829363,"Go to the clerk of the circuit court in your county. They have all the forms that you need to fill out to get a restraining order entered. Primarily there must be some violence, but you might qualify for a repeat violence injunction, which oddly does not actually require violence."
1811581,"Check with the local police but I believe you can call a tow company if the car blocks you from entering or exiting your driveway.

1826290,"Arizona does recognize the tort of defamation but the communication must be made to a third party, not just to you.Other than through the family court, there is probably not much you can do to stop your ex from sending nasty emails. However, if these accusations are communicated to third parties, you may want to consult with an attorney about filing a lawsuit for defamation."
1766055,"To be clear, since you have injuries from one accident, you have one claim for damages that should be brought against the two different parties (through their insurance companies).  If this matter goes to trial, you will probably bring one lawsuit and have the two drivers as two defendants, but prior to filing the lawsuit, you will negotiate individually with the insurance companies of the two drivers.  Technically, you may file two different lawsuits, but that probably is not wise.  Hence, since there are some traps that you need to avoid in order to maximize your recovery, you should seek advice, preferably representation, of an attorney.  Also, in order to bring a lawsuit for personal injury in Minnesota, you must meet the no-fault thresholds which an attorney can explain to you.  Best wishes,  Stan Zahorsky"

If he is identifying these photos as you, or if that is clear from their context, then the fact your face is obscured has no bearing on whether he is committing a crime. If it is you then it is you.  Cyberstalking.  Under Washington law cyberstalking is when a person intends to harass, intimidate, torment or embarrass another person, and in order to do that makes an electronic communication (email, text, chat, etc.) to that person, either (1) using lewd, indecent or obscene words or images or language, or (2)anonymously and repeatedly whether or not a conversation occurs, or (3) threatening to inflict injury on the person or their property or any ember of their family or household. Cyberstalking is a gross misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail for a first offense. If it involves threats to kill a person or if the person has a prior conviction for harassing the same person in the past, it is a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in jail. Cybertalking is also one of the few misdemeanor offenses that require someone convicted to give a DNA sample.  Extortion. A person is guilty of extortion in the second degree if he or she commits extortion by means of a wrongful threat as defined in *RCW 9A.04.110(25) (d) through (j). A threat means, among other things:   (28) ""Threat"" means to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent:      (e) To expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule; or      (f) To reveal any information sought to be concealed by the person threatened; or      (j) To do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety, business, financial condition, or personal relationships;  I would recommend you warn your ex boyfriend one time in writing that you want him to immediately cease sending these images to anyone. You need to put him on warning that you do not want these images distributed, period. Then at that point if he continues to make these threats or sends any images out you could  (1) seek a protection order from the Court to stop him from sending these images, stalking and harassing you, and/or (2) make a report to the Police about his activities.  I am a criminal defense attorney, but we also help people in your circumstance, as do a lot of other very good lawyers in the Tri Cities. I encourage you to consult with an attorney knowledgeable of how these issues are handled in your community to make the best choice about how to respond."

If it is not clear I advise that you consult with a local attorney. Many of us give free consults. Some, like myself, offer weekend or evening hours. You can find many attorneys on this Website.

1813396,"If the company lawyer represents the company, then you may benefit from having your own lawyer.  If the company is paying a lawyer to represent you, then the lawyer‰Ûªs ethical obligations are to you, not to the company, and you probably do not need another lawyer.   As for a counterclaim, it depends on how and where the person made the allegations.  Statements made in a court filing or other official legal process are usually protected by absolute privilege, meaning you can‰Ûªt sue for them even if they are defamatory.   Finally, you should hire counsel licensed to practice in the state where you did the work and/or the defamatory statements were made.  Lawyers from other states may not be aware of unique aspects of Virginia law."

Youso, but cannot fully agree with attorney Probst because you write you have "". . . sole legal and physical custody of all our children and the judge ordered . . ."" and it sounds like you have a final judgment, or at least a temporary order.  If a final judgment, then you have no reason to change your position because the court has awarded you sole decision making authority in the best interest of the children.  If it is a temporary order (which is likely, based on your further writing and the responses), then you may attempt to reach an agreement on terms acceptable to you, though you may also prepare to try the matter on the exact facts you present here, without the costly and unknown outcome of a Guardian ad litem.  I suggest you seek the advise of a Wisconsin licensed attorney that practices family law who has experience in custody and placement disputes involving out of state parties.  It is important enough you have an attorney, paying your advocate, instead of also paying a GAL, if possible.  Good luck."
1826226,"There is almost no chance you go to jail for something like this. Many states offer first offender programs which will allow the charge against you to be dismissed. You should hire an attorney or get a public defender to help guide you through the process to make sure you don't screw it up. But don't stress to much over this, it will be okay. Just make sure you learn your lesson as the courts are no fun to deal with and the more trouble you get in the worse the consequences will become."

If public assistance is involved, the government is not going to agree to anything less than what the statutes allow. You can always voluntarily pay more.  I have seen the child support tables (many times). Having raised children, I know the numbers in the tables generally are actually on the low side. So, if ""fair"" to you mean paying less than the number in the table, you actually mean you want to be less fair than what the committee came up with the for tables.  ""Can I get the government to leave child support arrangements to me and my ex?"" The problem is that you have not been taking care of the child support. That is why the government has been providing public assistance or the mother is asking the court to order  you to pay child support.  Your attorney can help  you with advocating what numbers to use to calculate the child support.  You should review the specific facts with your attorney to find out your legal options."
1807836,"The filing of an amended complaint begins a new round of pleadings.  The amended complaint supersedes the previous complaint as the ""operative"" pleading.  The practical effect is that each party is required to file a new response to the new (amended) complaint, regardless whether that party answered the previous complaint.  Each party has 30 days (or however many days the judge orders) to respond to the amended complaint.  To be clear, even a defendant who filed an answer to the previous complaint must file another answer to the amended complaint.  So in your example, both defendant A and defendant B are required to file a response to the amended complaint."

Adverse possession in Oregon requires (1) open, (2) notorious, (3) hostile, and (4) continuous possession of the subject property for the statutory period (10 years in most cases).

1802238,"If something is expunged, it is deleted from, wiped out from, erased from your record.  That means that it is no longer there.  I would not disclose something that is no longer there in a perfect world, but we do not live in one.  The issue that you could have by not disclosing is that, because the expungement will be new, it may not make its way into the NCIC database.  If that is the case and Idaho finds the conviction in a criminal background check, you would have some explaining to do.  You would likely want to show them a copy of the court order expunging the case, but it is a foreseeable risk.  Bottom line = that you should not have to disclose something that is not on your record, otherwise, why have expungements at all?  But you need to weigh the potential for Idaho to believe that you hid something, so you need to decide if you want to definitely explain up front or maybe explain later.    Good luck to you!  Please remember to designate answers as helpful and best."
1799482,"That they have not paid you a commission does not make for a hostile work environment., make for a breach of contract action or a labor pay action.  You may call the attorney general's office of DLLR: 410-230-6110 to see if they will help for free."
1809073,"When someone is alleged to have committed a crime, and there is probable cause that they did commit the crime, they are usually arrested and placed into custody to answer to those charges. Once in custody, they will remain in custody unless they are released on their own recognizance or they post bail. A bail setting is based on whether the person is a flight risk (the likelihood they will appear for court) and whether the person is a danger to the community at large (prior criminal history or violent nature of the offense). Once a person is placed on bail, that bail can be revoked by a judge for cause. I am not sure why your son was remanded, but if you believe his rights were violated in some manner you should consult with an attorney. Best of luck."
1819347,"I'm sorry to hear all that. Unfortunately, the defamation statute of limitations is a year for libel after the publication.    Defamation suits exist on the books but not really in real life. They are hard to win and damages tend to be low."
1814914,"Can they do this to you?  Yes they can and it appears that they have.  You'll be fine.  This happens all the time.  The prosecutor may have changed as well.   Although you no doubt feel that your case is somehow unique, more than likely it involves a fact pattern any public defender has seen hundreds of times.  Perhaps a new set of eyes on the case will help.  Don't fret, you'll be fine.  IF the new attorney needs more time to get ready he/she can request to continue the trial date."
1815615,You must follow up with the Embassy to obtain the visa as soon as possible.
1795051,"Within deadlines, if any, in the received letter, you should submit all the most recent evidence confirming the existence of a bona fide marriage. You need an attorney to prepare a letter stating that the grandfather was not a qualified witness due to the facts you stated in your question. You might need to add more supporting evidence to you petition, to improve your case. Otherwise, your green card would be denied, and the only option left then is an appeal. Your wife should hire an attorney soon."

1826634,You may continue you employment in India. Since you will not be in the US you will not be in H1b status while in India and that is fine. When you return to the US you will need to obtain an H1b visa if you do not already have one. Keep track of the time spent outside the US as you will be permitted to recapture your time.
1811481,"Bear in mind that the B1-B2 visa is a ""visitor visa,"" which means that you are not coming to live and work to the US. You can only stay for as long as the I-94 says. There is a possibility to request a 6-month extension. But staying in the US for too long may make it look as if your intent is not to ""visit"" but to ""immigrate,"" which creates a potential big problem for you.  On the F1 visa, you don't have to ""exchange it"" for a B1/B2. You could be granted F1 visa and hold on to the B1/B2, which remains valid as a matter of discretion. But if you abuse any of the two visas you could be denied entry at the border in the future."
1813469,"I am an attorney licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the States of Delaware and New Jersey.  My practice includes employment, business and health care law. Before I respond to your inquiry, I must state that we have not spoken, I have not reviewed the relevant documents and facts, and I do not represent you. Therefore, my discussion below is not a legal opinion, but is informational only. Finally, my discussion applies only to issues to which Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or Federal law applies.  That being said, if you will not be accessing, manipulating or transmitting patient data, then you likely have no HIPAA issue.  Simply because you create a tool that a customer uses will not create that liability.  If you are involved in the use of the tool, and have access to patient information, however, then you are a Business Associate and have your own HIPAA compliance obligations, and can be liable for civil money penalties for failure to comply.    If your design of the tool is negligent, then it is possible that the drug company could sue you for damages - you should make sure your contract limits your liability.  I suppose that a patient might be able to sue under a third party beneficiary/breach of contract  theory, but it seems unlikely to me.    There is no private right to sue under HIPAA, so affected patients would have to sue under state law for breach of privacy, etc.  You should look into whether you need HIPAA breach protection insurance; such insurance is available, but some of the insurers are new to that part of the industry.  I would recommend an established data privacy insurer.  /Christopher E. Ezold/"
1815887,"How much time is left on your boyfriends probation? The answer to that question is the amount of time he would still be facing. The judge can revoke all of his remaining probation. He needs to explain his side to the court, or better the probation officer. He should seriously consider contacting an attorney so the attorney can get more information and better analyze his options."
1804097,"The time limit for filing a workers' comp claim is one year.  You may be able to save this but it will be difficult.  I recommend retaining a good workers' comp lawyer.  Find one by using the ""Find a Lawyer"" tab at the top of this page or by going to www.caaa.org.  CAAA is the association for lawyers here in CA who represnt injured workrs."
1823763,"No, not necessarily any difference.  The HOA has the power and the duty to enforce both rules and policies.  Presumably, you are referring to the rules and policies as set forth in the CC&Rs of your HOA.  The CC&Rs are the governing documents."
1793282,She cannot bargain your parenting time with her demands for you you babysit at her convenience. If your agreement with her us in a court order you will need to go to court to either enforce it or modify it. If you had an attorney consult with him or her.
1793427,"You don't need a POA. Arguably, you are the psychological parent. If you have actively been the child's ""parent"" no court would break this bond. Also, if the other bio parent hasn't participated in the child's life for more than 6 months then technically they've abandoned the child and you can file a motion for such. Good luck, John"
1812516,Did your husband enter the country legally? If he came over illegally then the I-130 could take longer as his case is very complicated and you will need an attorney to prepare a waiver for you.
1796019,"Is there any way where you can plead and then have sentencing put over for a year and then dismissed?  If you have not plead yet, I'd push for this.  Especially first time offense.  In addition to the letter, you would want to show evidence of rehabilitation.  These include sending them: -- letter from you describing rehabilitative efforts or changes made to prevent future problems {sounds like you've done this but was it thorough enough?]  -- letters on official letterhead from professional counselors, instructors, employers, especially persons with knowledge of the alleged misconduct who attest to your character and profesional skills and that alcohol has not interfered with your work  -- letters from a therapist or doctor who attest that you do not have a problem with alcohol (if that's the case)    -- proof of community work, schooling, or other self-improvement efforts.   -- try to get any probation as short as possible and then get it terminated early and then expunged    -- if you want to show your current good mental status get a report by a clinical psychologist or therapist  This is just a starting point but you want that application to be as thorough as possible.  It would still be nice to see if you can get a more creative resolution on the criminal charge. Good luck"
1806608,"I'm not sure I understand your situation. The enhancability of your current case is going to depend on 1) what degree felony  the offense is all by itself, 2) what prior felony convictions you have that your actually been to prison for, and 3) if those priors were for non-state jail felonies, how many separate times you went to prison for them (e.g., if you were sentenced on all 3 of those 2nd degree offenses at the same time, they effectively only count as one enhancement, but if you got sentenced on one of them, did your time, and then got out to commit two more that you then went to prison for, that scenario could result in two usable enhancements). It's kinda complicated."
1827519,"I agree with my colleagues that your husband can probably make the change at the DMV this week.   However, a bigger concern is why your husband would allow someone, who apparently is not responsible, to manage his important personal affairs."
1909266,"If you or your family are in a position to hire a lawyer for a bond hearing, call my law partner Jerry Beaver at 910-323-4600. Beaver has over 40 years of experience handling complex criminal cases in Cumberland and Robeson County. He's a straight shooter and can provide you with an honest assessment of your bond situation.

1810905,"As long as you were not married when you got pregnant then there is no ""presumptive father"". This means that he is not the father until there is a DNA test. You can move right now if you want. To be on the safe side I would be sure to give him your contact information at the new place.   He can't ""press charges"" because you will not be breaking the law. Additionally, in California citizens do not press charges, only District Attorneys can file charges. Citizens report what they believe to be a crime and assist the DA and law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting crimes."
1811520,"I already answered your question under a different post.  I'm sorry to hear just how bad things have been going for you.  They will improve.  Why are you waiting until September to file?  It sounds like you already spoke to a bankruptcy attorney.  If so, why isn't that attorney giving you counsel on this issue?"
1829902,"there is no prosecutor at restraining order hearings. the party seeking the restraining order acts as the prosecutor since this is considered a civil case. you can contact the court to see if you can get an adjournment however this is not likely in a FRO hearing unless you have a very good excuse. if you do not show up, your wife will have to prove the case against you. if she does, she will get a restraining order based on her testimony. your restraining order will be dismissed if you do not show up. Having a restraining order entered against you can have very serious implications on your future life as it may prevent you from getting certain employment. You should consult with an attorney."
1826849,"Through the discovery process your attorney can have appraisals done of personal property in a home. Dealing with a self employed party requires a bit more diligence in ascertaining a persons true income. Often self employed people have a much higher standard of living on the same reported income as their W2 counterparts.  This can be because of certain tax advantages of self employment, payment of in kind expenses, and the ability to conceal cash receipts in certain cases.  By analyzing a persons standard of living and expenses you can make a case for the Court to impute income to a party.  It is often advisable to hire a good forensic accountant to help with this process."
1818591,If you do not have the required experience in programming to complement the certificate the USCIS will challenge the employers petition. The employer is better off to consult an experienced immigration attorney. Good Luck!
3170369,"I do not believe there is any truth to the idea that fathers are mistreated in family court. Instead, I believe that all taxpaying citizens are mistreated in family court.  For example, just yesterday, a Manhattan support magistrate (Weir Reeves) dismissed my client mother's paternity petition for her appearance yesterday morning. The case was on 11:30am time certain and my client mother was in the waiting area since 10:20am. I arrived at 11:20 and my adversary emailed me she was going to be late because she was stuck on a broken down bus. Weir Reeves' court officer never called out my client's name at any time while she was there in the waiting area. My adversary arrived at that point. When I approached the part clerk who stepped out from hiding to give another person some orders at 11:44am, he said the case was dismissed because no one showed up.  When the court officer (bailiff) badge #3065 came out, I asked what happened and this officer said no one was 'here'. My client mother said the officer never called her name. When I backed up my client who was telling the truth, badge #3065 said she could not believe how an officer of the court, me, could misrepresent the facts the way I was doing. I responded that indeed I was an officer of the court and I said I noted that at no time while I was there was the client's case called, not at 11:30am, not at all. I offered a simple fix -- let's all go in before the magistrate and stipulate to a restoration of the case to the calendar. Badge #3065 said the magistrate is not restoring any cases and I can file a motion to vacate the default and that I am a liar. Given the animosity exhibited by Badge #3065 and previously by the part clerk, I suspected that Weir Reeves wanted to commence her Labor Day week vacation early and that dismissing cases for peoples' non-appearance was an effective way to do that. Don't call the case, and dismiss it for petitioner's non-appearance.  I noted that despite a rather full calendar, the waiting area was nearly devoid of litigants at mid-day.  Ultimately, a little child has no father. So the family court shames and humiliates lawyers, both parents and the children it is charged to service and protect. The leadership environment in these courts is atrocious and its highest leaders must be fired and replaced. Court officers are rude and condescending to attorneys and are free to fabricate stories to protect their employment. Weir Reeves has used adjournments followed by dismissals in several of my prior cases and the only explanation I see for not expeditiously restoring a mistakenly dismissed case was that Weir Reeves wanted to lighten her daily work load and the case of an upcoming Labor Day weekend, clear up her calendar to start her holiday early.  Young fathers are not the only target. Everyone is a target and matters do not improve in Supreme Court. There, you will confront surly court attorneys and part clerks. User friendliness does not exist in Supreme Court and federal family policy is enforced with greater vigor in those courts, perhaps even more so than in family court which has compartmented courtrooms handling individual petitions and issues."
1793935,"As surviving spouse you have a constitutional right to live in the home until you die.  Now you need to address getting the home in your name.  This may or may not involve going to court, but when someone dies with no will and they have children from a prior marriage, then those kids inherit half of his real property.  The surviving spouse inherits the other half.  If the children want to, they could sign a quit claim deed or a gift deed giving you their interest in the home.  If they don't want to give it, you can try to pay them for it.  Otherwise, you live in the home until you die and then your estate could potentially force a sale of the home to liquidate it and give your share of the proceeds to your estate and the other share to the kids."
1961320,"It sounds like you are worried that the appellate court will find error in the original trial, reverse the conviction and remand for further proceedings, including a possible new trial in which, if he is convicted again, the judge will impose a harsher sentence than was originally imposed.  Is that correct? Based on the limited facts given, I can't tell you if that is a realistic worry or not.  Presumably, your appellate attorney can give you guidance.  In any event, you could probably avoid the risk by moving to withdraw the appeal which would probably be allowed."
1795787,"This is a question that would take some real research to answer unless an attorney who has been around that long happens to remember. OVI law changes more often than any other law. However, its usually not the minimums they change. It's a fair bet that the six month minimum has existed as long as the law. Also, you can find out how long your suspension was by calling the BMV or looking at the court records. I'm not sure why it would matter now what the minimum was 20 years ago. Surely it's been long enough for you to get your license reinstated."
1815556,"After reading your questions to Ms. Alperovich, who gave you excellent advice, I think you are asking about the procedure for handing in an  agreement. All you have to do is file for custody and go to the first conference. At that conference, the two of you tell the officer about your agreement, and it will be written up for you to sign right then and there. The officer will give it to a judge to sign and will mail you both a copy. The benefit to doing this is that the officer will help both of you tweak the agreement so that problems do not arise later on. For example, the holiday schedule can cause upset if it is not handled properly. Long weekends, summer vacations, etc. can all be set up by the conference officer in a fair manner that will make both of you happier."
1807200,"You mean you have one attorney and you want two?  Yes you can do that.  I was recently hired as a second attorney on a civil case.  Your current attorney's ego may be affected.  So discuss it with them.  Note, attorneys need time to prepare so if you are going to hire them do it soon so they can get up to speed on your case.  They also need to figure out how best to work together.  Someone will need to be the lead counsel for when there are difference of opinion and a decision needs to be made."
1815963,"How you handle this depends on the circumstances.    If you paid and would like a refund, I would start by speaking with the attorney frankly about what happened.    If you believe the lawyer was unethical in how she practices law, you can file a complaint with the disciplinary board, as my colleague suggested.  First you might want to take a look at the ethics rules and see what rule she might have violated. http://www.padisciplinaryboard.org/attorneys/rules/  If you believe, however, that your lawyer made mistakes that caused you financial damages, you might want to find another lawyer who practices in the same area and see if you have a legal malpractice claim.  Best of luck."
1800634,"Sounds like a big mess...and this does not sound like a typical ""probation."" You need to consult with an attorney and explain exactly what was required of you and why the judge is not accepting the community service proof you've submitted."
1828296,"They do not pursue criminal charges after allowing you to leave with an agreement to stay out of the store.  You will not have a criminal record, as you have not been arrested or charged."
1809799,"You can go to www.masscourts.org and check the probate records for the county in which your friend resided to see if a will was filed and who asked the court to be appointed as Personal Representative. If it was, then you'll need to the court house and pull the file to see what the will says. If there was a trust, chances are good that the PR knows who is the trustee, especially if the assets governed by the will are to be transferred to the trust's ownership."
1822840,"An appeal is not a do over to argue anew any and all points where one disagrees with the result in the court below.  The appellate court looks to see if the process was fair, including whether the lower court followed the law. And where the lower court has discretion in acting, it is only if the appellate court is persuaded the lower court abused that discretion will it overturn or modify a lower court ruling.  An appellate court does not tend to try and substitute its own interpretation of the facts in place of the lower court's interpretation.  Not many cases are reversed on appeal, which may be bad for particular appellants who do not get the relief they seek, but is a good indication that our trial court level process is not broken. If most appeals were successful, we'd have major problems at the lower court level."
1810751,It's possible but most judges want to see you do at least half if the probation. It won't hurt to ask and the worst case is the judge will say no. You have nothing to lose by trying. It is recommended you hire an attorney in your area to file the motion and argue it for you.
1830142,"You need to retain a real estate litigation attorney.  Yes, it is an issue that if these bushes were on part of your property and whether the neighbor had ownership and title rights to act as he did, but the bigger issue is the negative effect this may have had on the value of your home.  You may be entitled to damages due to the reduced value of your home, but this may or may not be proper at this time unless you are actively seeking to sell your home at this time.  Please consult with an attorney ASAP."
1796383,As long as you put no assets into the LLC and took no assets from the LLC you have no personal liability.  So just throw away the notices and stop worrying about it.
1798422,The Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge will wipe out any pre-petition damage to the vehicle.
1828755,"Presumably you will see what the current rep is seeking on his Fee Petition that you are being asked to sign.  Also, even after petitions are made, the judge will make a decision on the petition(s) and you will have an opportunity to dispute the amount...you will want to carefully review any Notice of Award regarding the attorney fee and if you choose to dispute, the Notice will contain instructions on how to do this.  As previously mentioned, the first rep MAY try to collect via fee petition as well unless s/he waived a fee.  Again, being looking at the Notices because you can dispute the attorney fee(s).  Glad you have this all getting sorted out now and I wish you the very best of luck for the future."
1659169,"Bottom line is that if you ever want to proceed with an eviction against a tenant, you need to have complied with Chapter 83, Florida Statutes, which requires you to deliver the 3-day notice.  Now, if you deliver the 3-day notice, and then accept payment from the tenant, you lose your rights to evict.  So, if you plan on going forward with an eviction in the event you do not receive payment from the tenant by a date certain, the 3-day notice must be delivered and you cannot accept the rental payment.  Per 83.56(4), you can mail, deliver, or if the tenant is absent from the premises, leave a copy of the notice at the premises.  I would err on the side of caution and comply with the statute in addition to e-mailing.  That's not an issue to litigate over.  I'd also recommend having a candid conversation with the tenant to be better advised as to the status and timing of the next few rental payments and then you can decide how best to proceed.   Good luck."
2041114,"If it is bad enough to be considered harassment then she can file for protective order.However I would be careful and make sure you check the birthdates of both your daughter and her ex-boyfriend. It sounds like one was an adult and the other was child and there could be statutory rape charges.  How old was he when she was having sex with him?"
1805245,"More than likely your child's other parent is permitted to take the child out of state, provided that is his/her parenting time.  Sole custody has nothing to do with the ability to bring the child out of state for less than a day if the child is properly in that parent's possession.  You need to review your parenting agreement.  If you do not understand, return to your lawyer or consult with a new one."
1814086,"You may need to seek to have the decree enforced and/or clarified. Consult with an attorney about your situation. She or he will want to review the decree. Subsequently, he or she can advise you on your options and next steps."
1796137,"I agree with Mr Rafter. The issue of personal jurisdiction can get quite involved but depends on the nature of the complaint. Also, you would have needed to serve him properly. If he files an answer, that would likely waive any challenge as to ineffective service or lack of personal jurisdiction. But you should consider hiring an attorney, who is trained in dealing with such issues."
1816161,"They are ""outside"" the scope of probate. Contests are usually based on incompetence, undue influence  or fraud. It all depends on the facts of the situation."
1953133,"There is no such thing as legal separation in New Jersey. There is, however, a divorce from bed and board, which is the closest thing. This severs the financial ties between the parties, but is a good option for people whose religion prohibits divorce or who have other personal reasons for not wanting a divorce. There are drawbacks to a divorce from bed and board, including but not limited to the fact that both parties must  consent to a divorce from bed and board and it prohibits remarriage.   With respect to divorcing a person that has a disability and is unable to manage their own affairs ‰ÛÒ legal or otherwise, you may want to consider asking the court to appoint an attorney and/or a guardian ad litem for the person and guardianship proceedings in the probate part may actually be necessary if there is a question as to the person‰Ûªs capacity. An attorney will advocate for the client‰Ûªs wishes, but a guardian ad litem‰Ûªs job is to recommend to the court what he or she determines that person‰Ûªs best interests to be. They serve two different roles and in some cases, both are necessary and/or appropriate.  Divorces can be highly complicated, especially when one party suffers from a disability and requires court-appointed assistance. It is important that you discuss the specifics of your case with an experienced matrimonial attorney who also has experience with guardianship matters to determine what steps you will need to take to protect your interests in a divorce.  Additionally, below are links to articles and information that may assist you with your case."
1826663,"Provided the three grown children are specific beneficiaries in the trust, I would imagine CA law can NOT prevent them from receiving the trust document.  The same goes for the will.  Assuming a will was offered for probate, the three children should be able to review it as well.    As Michael suggested above, contact an estate attorney in CA (use the Avvo Find a Lawyer); look for one experienced in both Estate Planning and Estate Administration/Probate.  Good luck!"
1800337,"You definitely need to apply for a Public Defender to try to hire an attorney with a slow pay/low pay arrangement. It sounds from the facts that you have provided us that it is outrageous that you were charged with a DUI and it would ""seemingly"" be easy to convince the DA to drop the charges."
1826436,"If you didn't know about the judgment until now, 18 years later, you were likely never served.  You can seek to vacate the judgment by alleging lack of service."
1834600,"On top of the two fine responses you've received, note that most (not all) real estate sales contracts will have a clause awarding attorney fees to prevailing party and an address stating where to give notice. Do a demand in writing. Give them 10 days to comply. If they fail to do so, and there is such a clause, a consumer protection firm  would likely handle on a contingency."
1820782,"With due respect to my friend Scott who is a great lawyer, this time I disagree.  The law says more that just providing the alcohol constitutes a crime.  You can be charged if you allow him to consume alcohol.  Here is the law:  Md. CRIMINAL LAW Code Ann. å¤ 10-117  (2014)  å¤ 10-117. Furnishing for or allowing underage consumption       (a) Furnishing alcohol. -- Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person may not furnish an alcoholic beverage to an individual if:     (1) the person furnishing the alcoholic beverage knows that the individual is under the age of 21 years; and     (2) the alcoholic beverage is furnished for the purpose of consumption by the individual under the age of 21 years.  (b) Allowing possession or consumption of alcohol. -- Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an adult may not knowingly and willfully allow an individual under the age of 21 years actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage at a residence, or within the curtilage of a residence that the adult owns or leases and in which the adult resides.  (c) Exceptions. --     (1) The prohibition set forth in subsection (a) of this section does not apply if the person furnishing the alcoholic beverage and the individual to whom the alcoholic beverage is furnished:        (i) are members of the same immediate family, and the alcoholic beverage is furnished and consumed in a private residence or within the curtilage of the residence; or        (ii) are participants in a religious ceremony.     (2) The prohibition set forth in subsection (b) of this section does not apply if the adult allowing the possession or consumption of the alcoholic beverage and the individual under the age of 21 years who possesses or consumes the alcoholic beverage:        (i) are members of the same immediate family, and the alcoholic beverage is possessed and consumed in a private residence, or within the curtilage of the residence, of the adult; or        (ii) are participants in a religious ceremony.  Read this and make sure your actions take this law into account.  you can always be charged depending on how a prosecutor views your actions, but you should be able to take steps to demonstrate your efforts if you read this and follow it"
1802860,"If you write things in a journal that is not at the direction of counsel, it is not protected. If you meet with an attorney, your conversations with that attorney are privileged, even if you do not retain that attorney. If your attorney asks you to make entries in a journal, that may be protected by work product privilege. If you have no counsel and just write entries for yourself, it is subject to discovery."
1823895,"Attorneys are officers of the court and are held to a higher standard.  The real question is whether her statement adversely affected your case and whether it was done with malice.   If so, then you should advise the court via motion of the incorrect statement and provide proof of compliance.  If you feel the attorney violated the rules of professional conduct then you can file a grievance, but you should read the rules on the Florida Bar website.  You will not get a letter of apology from the attorney, as it will be an admission.  I don't think the statement is slanderous.    As an attorney, I take great offense to opposing counsel making incorrect statements of fact to the court and I will call them out in open court.  Most judges know the attorneys that appear before them and they know the ones that are credible versus the ones that are just blowing smoke."

If you provided a breath test, the officer may have failed to observe you for 20 minutes before administering the test.

1808781,"I hope that you were successful at your recent hearing. The rules differ somewhat based on the program that you are qualified for benefits under. If you are approved, and only receive, Social Security Disability Insurance, their is an exact earnings limit called Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA). The amount of SGA changes in January of each calendar year, but in 2014, it is $1,070 of gross income per month. If you are able to make $1,070 or more, and you have used all your trial work months, you no longer qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance while you continue to make SGA. Luckily, you have 9 Trial Work Months to attempt work before this earnings limit is used. You use a trial work month if you earn more than $770 in any month in 2014 (this number also changes in January of each year). While you still have trial work months available, you can make any dollar amount without losing your benefit. However after you have went over the trial work amount in 9 months within a 60 month period of time, you must remain below SGA to keep your benefits.  If you are approved, the type of work that you do cannot cause a medical review of your claim, but if your claim is medically reviewed, the type of part-time work you do can be considered if medical improvement is proved. This means that if you are approved based on mental health/psychological functioning, but you perform work on a set schedule, that requires you to deal with the public on a regular basis, and requires attention to detail, focus and concentration, the ability to perform this type of work could have an impact on your keeping your benefits when you are reviewed for medical improvement.  If you only qualify for SSI, the earnings test is slightly different. For SSI purposes, you lose $1 for every $2 that you earn after your first $65 of income. You must report all income to SSI, and there is no trial work period. The good news is if you are able to work part-time, you can potentially make more money under the SSI program than you can under SSDI before losing your benefits. The bad news is that work does reduce your month SSI payment. Also, just like under SSDI, if you are medically reviewed, the type of work you are doing can have an impact on the decision of whether you remain disabled.  I hope this information helps. I would also recommend using Social Security's Ticket to Work program if you are approved. This way you are provided with job coaching, and with experts to advise on the impact that your work would have on your benefits."

This is a divorce statute but it has been made to apply in paternity actions by case law."
1808534,"First, you need to understand that if you do blow and the number is above a .08, you face (assuming this is your first DUI) a 6 month suspension of drivers license.  If you do not blow, you face a 12 month suspension. However, when you blow, you are providing evidence the courts will use against you. I only recommend people blow into any machine if they are certain they will blow below the legal limit (really, only if they are certain they will blow zeros).  The reason is that despite the longer suspension, the less evidence you provide the officer(s), the better your case might go.   Here is the basic advice I give to people who ask this question: 1) always ALWAYS be polite, courteous and respectful to the officer(s).  Attitude won't help and tends instead to hurt your case 2)  Upon request, tender your drivers license and insurance information. 3)  If you are inside a vehicle, decline to exit the vehicle respectfully unless ordered to do so, then comply fully (in other words, if asked out of a car, ask the officer if he is ordering you out of the vehicle or asking if you would voluntarily exit - usually, it's an order). 4)  Decline to answer any questions or make any statements without your attorney present (you must disclose biographical information, not what you've been doing, why you are there, if you've been drinking, where you are coming from, etc) 5)  Do not consent to any testing or any kind until you have spoken with an attorney. Bear in mind that an officer may arrest you if they believe you are under the influence of alcohol, but any field sobriety tests (including the breathalyzer, questioning, walk and turn, heel/toe, finger to nose, etc) is being done not to clear you of a potential charge, but to confirm the officers suspicion and to collect evidence for use against you.  To be clear, this means declining the one leg stand, the walk and turn, the HGN/VGN, the portable breathalyzer, and the breathalyzer offered in the station. 6)  Ask the officer to advise you if you are free to leave or not.  If not, remain compliant.  If so, thank the officer, wish them a nice evening, and leave. You have no right to an attorney until you are under arrest and being questioned.  If you are asked questions once back at the station that are not biographical in nature (date of birth, where you live, age, etc), decline to answer and immediately, but politely, tell the officer that you refuse to make any statement or answer any questions without your lawyer present.  The police may try to make fun of you, try to make you feel bad, or try to tell you that it is in your best interest to speak to them.  It very, very rarely is.  Ask to speak to your lawyer and no matter how much time has passed, no matter what the officer may say, remain silent save to reiterate your desire to have an attorney present prior to any questioning.  They are legally required to cease any interrogation. If you are arrested and processed, remain compliant, polite, and courteous.  Once released, schedule more than one consultation with an attorney that handles DUI regularly in the county where your case will be heard.  Speak with these lawyers candidly and expect them to discuss DUI law, your suspension, next steps, price (both with and without trial), and for them to answer your questions.  If your consultation consists of the lawyer telling you the cost and to meet them in court and nothing else, walk away. Find the right lawyer that you can trust and that you believe will work hard to defend your case. Best of luck.  Hope this helps."
1819867,"Without knowing more, I can't take a position on whether its too late.  What was the last day of work done on the job site?  Regardless, the requirements for the perfection of a lien claim are generally set forth in section 38-22-109, C.R.S.  There are important statutory deadlines for mechanics liens so you need to read the statute carefully and you'll need to do that immediately.  Usually, you have to first send a notice of intent to lien, which is followed by the mechanics lien filing.    If you do it right, what have you got?  Well, you've got a lien, which is probably junior to the first deed of trust.  If you want to then foreclose the lien, you'd have to pay off the liens in higher priority.  Yes, you should look at doing filing a lien because that might make the homeowner breach a covenant in their first deed of trust and the bank may not like that.  However, to get other remedies, like garnishment, you're going to need to file a breach of contract action.  Since its for $9K, I'd file it in Denver County (not District) Court.  If the homeowner answers, you'll probably be sent to mediation with ""CMS.""  Does you contract provide for your recovery of attorneys' fees?  That would make a lawsuit a bit more palatable for you."
1812056,"You potentially run into a problem called ""hearsay"" with your friend's statement. Hearsay is ""an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted"" and is generally barred from evidence. Here, you potentially have 2 layers of hearsay -- one is your father's out-of-court statement and the second being your friend's out-of-court written statement.  You will need to find ""exceptions"" to the hearsay rule to get this evidence in. For the first layer, there is an exception for statements made by a party to the proceeding (i.e your father). See California Evidence Code section 1220. For the second layer of hearsay (your friend's written statement), you probably don't have an exception to rely on. Although declarations (sworn written statements) can be presented as admissible evidence in some family law hearings, they cannot be presented at trials. A DVTRO hearing is essentially a ""mini-trial."" Thus, you would be safest to have your friend come in and testify (and you have that right!). All this being said, if the other party doesn't ""object"" to the written statement and the judge chooses to consider it, it would come in as evidence anyway -- I just wouldn't rely on this (and even if it was considered, the judge might give it very little weight). Regarding notarization, notarizing the statement would not have an affect on it being admissible as evidence. Hope this helps!"

718404,"This is a great question. It is true that referral fees are not allowed in bankruptcy.   However, to understand the reason you have to back track through quite a few different sections of the Bankruptcy Code in order to find the answer. (If traffic signs were as confusing as the rules governing this question, I'm afraid that very few people would ever find their way to any destination.) However, it is kind of fun, so here we go:  Bankruptcy Code Section 504 (Sharing of Compensation), very clearly provides that compensation, (including lawyer fees), may not be shared with any persons outside of one's own firm. The only exception is for fees required to be paid to a bona fide public service attorney referral program operated in accordance with local state law, such as a county bar  sponsored referral panel.  Section 504 implicates the provisions of Section 503(b)(2), which leads you back the provisions of Section 330, which leads you back to Section 329 of the Bankruptcy Code which which covers any fees paid to a lawyer on behalf of a debtor!   Hence, no referral fees. So, there you are, legalized torture. Tell your cousin I said welcome to bankruptcy law."

Because of the ages of the individuals, she may be charged with misdemeanor (if she is within four years of age) or a felony if she is over four years older than the student.  I believe there may be a valid defense to this if she is charged because she doesn't have her degree, but whoever this is is making terrible life choices putting her career and freedom at risk for a 17 year old boy.  The fact that it may not be a crime according to the technical language of the code does not obscure the fact that there is most definitely a policy in place that would call for her immediate termination if this were known by her employers."

It's scary, but not knowing isn't doing you any favors and could actually cause you greater harm--some infections are easier to deal with the earlier they're caught, and others are diagnosed based on changes in your body's chemistry that can only be identified once you have a ""baseline"".  Your first priority should be your health (and whether you have a case will depend on whether you have any damages, so a lawyer will be useless if you're unwilling to go forward with monitoring and taking care of your health).  Go get whatever blood work that is recommended done and keep up with the monitoring--there are typically set schedules for testing for different possible infections after exposures like this (e.g. HIV tests in these situations occur several times over a course of months to be certain that you are negative).

In cases of contempt, the court is able to compel the contemnor (the guilty party) to pay attorney's fees.  Good luck to you."

1801493,"I would need more information to answer this question.  In Indiana, a grandparent may petition the court for visitation if the child's parent is deceased, the marriage of the child's parents has been dissolved, or if it is a child born out of wedlock situation, once the biological father has established paternity.  You stated that your grandson may have to go to foster care.  If this is the case I would need to know where mom is.  And if this is a Child In Need of Services case then the department of child services would have to consider you for placement before the child could be placed in foster care.  Alternatively, you could petition the court to appoint you as a de facto custodian of your grandson.  however, you would need to establish that you were his primary caregiver, provided financial support for him and that he resided with you for a period of 6 months if he is less than 3 years of age or 1 year if he is at least 3 years of age."
1799265,"It sounds like you are concerned about who will get your residence if you divorce. How long have you been married and living in the house? The general rule is that a party who inherits property during a marriage can keep that property in a divorce.  But, there are exceptions to the rule that allow the property or portions of the equity to be divided in a divorce.  There are legal arguments that you should discuss in detail with an attorney.    Your posts here are not confidential, but your communications with an attorney are. Consider contacting an attorney about your case to discuss it in detail.  If you have children, you will want to discuss child support.  You probably need to ask about the prospect of alimony too.  If you have any debts that you or he took on during the marriage, they will be an issue in the divorce also.  I recommend that you obtain a consultation with an attorney.  Many attorneys on this website offer free consultations where you can discuss these very important concerns in a confidential setting."
1815765,"The question is whether or not Florida has jurisdiction over the child, and if the child has only been out of Florida for three months the answer is probably yes.  DO NOT try to make jurisdictional arguments on your own, they are some of the most complicated arguments in the law.  You need to actually go in and consult with an attorney who has handled jurisdictional issues before and have all your paperwork and your facts reviewed."
1802484,"While I agree that you should consult with a lawyer, to answer your question, you need to complete a short form financial statement.  The financial statement is based on current income, which in your case is less than 75K per year.  Income should be your unemployment compensation (assuming you are receiving it) and any other income you are receiving from interest, investments or other sources.  Your expenses, like your income, should be listed as they are at the time the financial statement is presented to the Court.  The link below should help."
1822191,"This is a tricky situation because whether a nurse case manager is going to be working to help expedite treatment for you (and some of them do) or whether she's going to be primarily focused on getting the doctor to release you from treatment as soon as possible (which is the objective of some of them) depends on the identity of the rehab nurse (and the company he or she works for).  If you have been referred to a neurosurgeon for your work injury, I think you should seriously consider hiring a lawyer to help you with your claim.  The primary factor determining the need for a lawyer is the severity of your injury.  If you have an injury that is likely to result in some permanent impairment, having an experienced lawyer help you should assist you in obtaining a better monetary recovery and in protecting future medical rights."
1816483,"If you have doubts, fears or concerns then yes... consult a professional.  The nominal cost of a consultation fee may protect your property and custody interests and make sure you are informed and comfortable with a settlement before you sign it.

1811574,"I agree with my colleague, to an extent.  If YOU accepted the notice of 20 days and relied upon that notice, I would say that her lease terminates at the end of the 20 days.  Generally, when a person gives insufficient notice, it is the party to whom the insufficient notice is given that has the right to challenge the notice.  Here, since you appear to have waived the right to receive a full 30 days notice, I would think that she needs to leave.    That being said, you did the right thing by also giving her a full thirty days notice.  Because your lease is likely commercial in nature, the process for evicting a non-paying tenant is a little simpler than it would be to evict a residential tenant.  How easy it is depends, in part, on the terms of your lease.  I would suggest that you speak with an attorney who can help  you to evaluate your options and develop a winning strategy to remove your toxic tenant."

Good luck."
1794303,I agree with my colleagues.  The assumption is that a marriage less than 2 years old is entered into fraudulently so it is up to you to prove otherwise.  The officer will look at the entire picture to see if you are in fact married in good faith.  A static bank account with little activity may raise a red flag.  But if there is activity on the account I doubt if they will look into who is using it more.  Consult with an immigration attorney to make sure your shared life package is strong.
1817915,"As one of my colleagues noted, it may be possible for your to ""convert"" your jointly filed petition into a ""good faith marriage waiver"" petition.  There is a USCIS memorandum that addresses this topic and states, essentially, that USCIS can issue a request for evidence letter asking for the final judgment of divorce.   This gives you time to secure the final judgment, provide a copy to USCIS, and then let them adjudicate the case as a good faith marriage waiver.  In that scenario, there would be no need to re-file the case.  Sometimes, however, the tricky part is getting a final judgment of divorce before the due date on the request for evidence letter.  Although rare, if still legally married at the interview (if USCIS schedules an I-751 interview [as they can waive that]) and so long as you and your estranged spouse both appear, the case can still be approved as a joint petition.  Unless your U.S. Citizen spouse expressly wrote to USCIS to withdraw the petition, it can still be adjudicated as a joint petition even though you are having marital problems.  It's not the viability of the marriage that counts; it's whether it was entered in good faith.  Concerning your ""extension . . . expiring in six months""; so long as your I-751 remains pending, even beyond the 1 year of extended status granted by the I-751 receipt notice, you can get a temporary I-551 stamp (evidencing that you are still a permanent resident) at a local USCIS office.  You should likely consult with a competent immigration attorney who can discuss these things I have mentioned and other items.  So long as your marriage was bona fide, you have options."
1819372,"California does not have a true ""expungement"" statute. What we do have is a dismissal under Penal Code 1203.4. If granted, it doesn't wipe the case off your record, but it adds a notation that the case was dismissed. That allows you to tell most employers that you have not been convicted of the crime, but it remains on your record and still counts as a prior conviction.   Not every felony (currently) can be reduced to a misdemeanor. Your friend may want to (if hey can) wait until after the election to see if the law changes and makes all simple possession charges ""wobblers"" that can be reduced to misdemeanors.  But to answer your question, no there is no limit on when you can file for a dismissal under 1203.4.  This may be worth a local criminal defense attorney's help. It's not complicated, so it should not cost much, but your friend should know all of their options."
1822565,"I would recommend you seek an Order of Protection (or an OP).  An OP does essentially the same thing as a Restraining Order but they are two different things.  An OP is designed to deal with exactly these types of situations.  An OP is easier to obtain and the law provides for you to be awarded attorney fees if you are successful.  The problem is you would still have to appear in Court in order to obtain a 1 year Order of Protection.  While I understand this process can be intimidating and cause you a lot of discomfort, I cannot think of any way you can achieve the result you want without having to make a Court appearance.  If you are really unwilling to come to court, you might want to consider changing your telephone number, and you email address.  Hopefully that will be enough to keep him from continuing to harass you.  Consider speaking to an attorney who might be willing to help you.  You might find someone from your local bar association or Legal Aid might be able to assist you.  Good luck."

You may also ask to use your PTO as an accommodation.  They are in the wrong here.

1819163,"I am not a MN lawyer so I cannot comment on matters of MN law or procedure.    However,  were your fact pattern a matter of Florida law, then I, a 22+ year veteran Florida criminal defense lawyer, would tell you that, unless some extremely unlikely security issue exists, then your Affidavit in Support of the VOP Warrant is a matter of public record, it is in the Clerk of Court's file and is available for anyone to pull, inspect and copy, including you (if you are foolish enough to trek into the Courthouse and try to pull the file yourself).  I can also comment about the nature of warrants in general (again, limiting my commentary as a Florida and not a MN lawyer) and in that regard I would opine that the bottom line with warrants is that they suck (well that and that oftentimes they end up in untimely and inconvenient incarceration).    When it comes to the subject of warrants, anyone anywhere who has knowledge of the existence of the warrant has 2 choices:  Either they can deal with it proactively, in an offensive manner or they can live day to day, waiting until it is ultimately served, and then play catch-up (defense).   In this light warrants can be likened to cancer. If it exists (whether it is a warrant or cancer) then you have a problem. You can either choose to deal with the problem and hope for the best or you can wait for the problem to deal with you in its own natural fashion. In the former event it may or may not work out favorably for you, but, in the case of a warrant, at least the State and the Judge will have to acknowledge that you voluntarily chose to bring the matter to them (which is an undeniable fact that even an inexperienced lawyer should be able to use your advantage during the pendency of your case). In the later event, however, just as with cancer, the longer that you choose to wait (whether in denial, self-pity or simply because you are lost in hope, desperation and prayer that it'll heal itself / go away) then more time that it has to metasticize and destroy you from within.  You may well have defenses to your charge (as I said I am not an MN lawyer and I know less than nothing about MN law - you should certainly discuss the same with an experienced Mendota Heights, MN area criminal defense practicioner) but, right, wrong or indifferent I am confident that the warrant is a veritable cancer which will almost surely prejudice you, whether with the Court, the State or both, sometime down the legal pike.   I hope that I have been helpful in answering your question."

Generally speaking, if she is young, able bodied, and educated, other than perhaps some support for a limited period of time, it would not seem she would be entitled to anything long term.   The length of your marriage is in the moderate range.  The Court could consider some type alimony called ""bridge the gap"" which would be for a short period of time to meet specific goals.  The Court could consider durational alimony which would be alimony for a set period of time not to exceed the length of the marriage.  The Court could consider rehabilitative alimony if this is needed to re-educate your wife to get her back into the work force.  There would be no set guidelines currently existing for you to look at to ascertain an amount nor duration.  In sum, there is no simple answer to this question."

On the other hand, it also seems pretty obvious that you should have been more careful, so I wouldn't be surprised if your insurance company offers to settle.    Let your insurance company worry about this. If you get sued, your insurance company will hire an attorney to represent you at no cost to you.

1797377,"I recommend that you try calling the HR department. If they refuse to answer your question then California employment law provides a method for you to get a copy of you employment file, which should note your termination date.  Effective January 1, 2013, California law provides that current and former employees (or a representative) have the right to inspect and receive a copy of the personnel files and records that relate to the employee‰Ûªs performance or to any grievance concerning the employee. Labor Code Section 1198.5  Inspections must be allowed at reasonable times and intervals, but not later than 30 calendar days from the date the employer receives a written request. Upon a written request from a current or former employee, or a representative, the employer shall provide a copy of the personnel records, at a charge not to exceed the actual cost of reproduction, not less than 30 calendar days from the date the employer receives the request. To facilitate the inspection, employers shall do all of the following: (1) maintain a copy of each employee‰Ûªs personnel records for a period of not less than three years after termination of employment, (2) make a current employee‰Ûªs personnel records available for inspection, and if requested by the employee or representative, provide a copy at the place where the employee reports to work, or at another location agreeable to the employer and the requester. If the employee is required to inspect or receive a copy at a location other than the place where he or she reports to work, no loss of compensation to the employee is permitted, (3) make a former employee‰Ûªs personnel records available for inspection, and if requested by the employee or representative, provide a copy at the location where the employer stores the records, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to a different location.  A former employee may receive a copy by mail if he or she reimburses the employer for actual postal expenses.  An employer is not required to comply with more than 50 requests to inspect and receive a copy of personnel records filed by a representative or representatives of employees in one calendar month.  The employer may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of a current or former employee or an authorized representative.  Prior to making records available for inspection or providing a copy of those records, the employer may redact the name of any nonsupervisory employee. If a former employee seeking to inspect his or her personnel records was terminated for a violation of law, or an employment-related policy, involving harassment or workplace violence, the employer may comply with the request by doing one of the following: (1) making the personnel records available to the former employee for inspection at a location other than the workplace that is within a reasonable driving distance of the former employee‰Ûªs residence, (2) providing a copy of the personnel records by mail. If an employer fails to permit a current employee, former employee, or representative to inspect or copy personnel records within the times specified, or times agreed to by mutual agreement , the current employee, former employee, or the Labor Commissioner may recover a penalty of $750.00 from the employer.  A current or former employee may also bring an action for injunctive relief to obtain compliance, and may recover costs and reasonable attorney‰Ûªs fees in such an action through the court process. The right to inspect personnel files and records does not apply to records relating to the investigation of a possible criminal offense, letters of reference, or ratings, report"

1736028,"I would recommend consulting with a lawyer.  The lawyer will need to pull up the federal docket sheet for the case on the electronic court system to learn the exact statutes under which you were charged, and cross check the statute of limitation for that charge.  You mentioned an Indictment, but there are actually three ways you can be charged in federal court: criminal complaint, information, or indictment.  It would be good for you to understand the difference.  If you were actually indicted, it means the grand jury met and found there was probable cause to charge you.  Unfortunately this matter is a bit too fact-specific to lend itself to the type of general advice offered here, but I do agree with the other posters.  The time to object to a dismissal without prejudice is at the time of dismissal. However, that dismissal and the remoteness of the alleged offense will give you great defenses should a charge ever reappear.  Take heart in the fact that a prosecutor almost NEVER moves to dismiss a charge with prejudice.  It's a basic policy matter, but that doesn't mean that they ever intend to bring the case back.  However, a lawyer can make a quick call to the U.S. Attorney and check on the status."

If so then I agree with the previous post - you should contact the opposing attorney and clarify.  I think you are asking whether you need to do anything to respond to the Notice of Settlement.  Usually that document is just to notify the court that the matter has been settled.  If you agree with the terms contained in the Notice of Settlement there really isn't any type of ""answer"" you need to file.  I would appear at trial and make sure that the settlement agreement is entered/set forth as you agreed to it (always appear at any hearing because you don't want anything going on without you knowing) but other than that, it seems as if you should be all set."

You are still entitled to have all the procedures followed, such as proper notice before filing an eviction (if that is what they filed).  it may also be that there is no landlord-tenant relationship between you and thus an eviction may be the wrong form of legal action to take against you.  While he may be able to get rid of you eventually, you may be able to get a bit more time and maybe a creative attorney can come up with some sort of equitable argument as to why you have a right to the property.

1806936,"First of all your mother was apparently living in Texas when she died so you may need to contact an attorney in Texas and the local laws in Texas will apply.  You sister may be correct that probate is not warranted.  (In most states probate is not legally required when someone dies.   It is just an optional tool that can be used to settle up the final affairs of an estate.)  It is often the case that a person uses up their assets for their final care at the end of their life.  When this happens there may be no need to probate anything.  This still doesn't explain why your sister won't give you a copy of the will and an explanation of how your mother's money was managed in the end.  While you might need a Texas lawyer if you need to use Texas law to compel this type of disclosure and accounting, I suspect you could go and talk to a Portland Lawyer who could contact your sister and convince her to at least give you the information and accounting you are after.  Incidentally, the Power of Attorney is a different role then an executor of a will although the same person may be named for both roles.  Once a person dies the person that was acting as a Power of Attorney no longer has that power to act.  If they do anything after the death of the person they are most likely acting as the Executor of the Will.  However someone that previously acted under a Power of Attorney was acting as a fiduciary and they continue to be liable for accounting for how they used or spent funds during the period that they were empowered to act as a Power of Attorney and they can be liable for any mismanagement of funds.  Most states have laws that prohibit elder abuse which includes misusing the funds of an elderly or disabled person and this can have criminal penalties.  For these reasons I think a request from an attorney, either in Oregon or Texas should motivate your sister to be a little more cooperative.  You have to be prepared however to accept that even with the information disclosed, you may find that your sister is being truthful and there really isn't any money or property left over to be distributed."

You are in a community property state where there  will be unique issues relating to  community property.

Though not impossible, it is difficult to even obtain a green card from DACA status, and you usually have to go through a couple of initial procedures to be able to do so.  A green card must necessarily come before citizenship, so you have to start there.

You want to be sure to draft estate plans which will allow an attorney-in-fact to transfer funds to your son's trust if you are alive but not competent and a will which will direct the inheritance to that trust.   Having your daughter simply hand your son money as need will definitely jeopardize his benefits, as such hand-outs will be considered ""gifts"" by most agencies. Besides, any money given to your daughter will be exposed to HER creditors. If she divorces or is sued, that money can be easily lost.  Additionally, you need to consider the possibility that asking your daughter to be in charge of these funds may become a significant burden on her, particularly if her family or job needs her attention.   You also need to give very careful thought to who will be trustee. You need to be sure that the trustee is truly trustworthy, knows the difference in the rules between the various public benefits programs or will take the time to learn them, is able to keep  very good records, and will be able and willing to work with an experienced special needs planning attorney. This is not a decision to be made automatically or lightly. If your daughter doesn't fit this description, then she shouldn't be the trustee. She could still take a role as a watchdog over the trustee, however.  Good planning isn't necessarily cheap; however, you have to consider the cost of what could happen to your son if things go wrong. Find someone who knows what they're really doing. You can start by looking for a member of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, www.naela.org  Good luck!"

1789911,"Dear Jamaica Tenant:  The lease for the space may allow the landlord to ignore a complaint about mold penetrating a wall in the room in the basement. If in fact the lease explicitly commits the landlord to perform the remediation, as suggested to you by Mr. Weinman, the expense of an attorney to fight the landlord may be greater than the cost to you to fix the condition on your own. You have a ten year lease and so you may be better off doing the mold remediation with your chose contractor than relying upon the landlord.   You should verify that the basement space is legal for your practice. The Certificate of Occupancy should allow for use as a medical office. If not, or if no legal use is permitted, go back to your lawyer to figure out why that is so.  You may be correct that the source of the moisture penetrating the wall is outside the confines of the office space. You will need an expert opinion (from your contractor) to support that fact if you do decide that court is the required arena to resolver this problem.  If you have not formally communicated in writing to the landlord, review the ""notice"" terms of the lease for the proper method to place the landlord on notice of the defective condition in the basement."

1821296,"Under Georgia law, if a person dies intestate (which means the person does not have a Will), then the title to any interest that person owned in Georgia real estate will pass in one of two ways: (1) if the real estate is owned jointly with one or more other owners as ""joint tenants"" (this is controlled by the deed), then the person's interest automatically transfers to the surviving joint tenants and his estate does not receive any interest. (2) If the person owns real estate in Georgia as either the sole owner or as a tenant in common (again, this is controlled by the deed - the default for joint ownership is tenancy in common, however, so if the deed does not clearly indicate a joint tenacy, it  doesn't created one), then the person's interest in the property is said to immediately vest in his heirs. However, if an administrator is appointed for the person's estate, then the heirs are divested of title. This does not make sense, necessarily, it's just the way the law works. I believe the intent was to allow real estate to be dealt with even if no administrator was appointed for an intestate person's estate, but to ensure that the administrator could control the real estate if one was appointed. Once the administrator is appointed, the administrator will eventually need to transfer the property back to the heirs, if it isn't sold to pay debts or for other purposes out of the estate.  So, if you are an heir to a person's estate, and that person had no Will, then you would have temporarily taken an interest in that person's Georgia real estate, but once an administrator was appointed, the interest you originally held is no longer held by you - the administrator has it.  Now - you mention someone serving as the Executor. If there really is an Executor, and not an Administrator, that means the person who owned the real estate DID have a Will. Under Georgia law, if the person HAD a Will, there is no immediate transfer of title to the heirs. Instead, the title is deemed to have remained in the person's probate estate, and the Executor, once appointed, can control the real estate interests.  If you want specific answers to specific questions about a real situation, you really should consult your own attorney rather than posting here. The reason for that is that the variables which need to be considered are too many, and this is not a suitable place for a consultation."
1825108,"It really depends on the lease.  Generally, leases contain language that voids the lease if there is such an issue.  Even if there is such a lease provision, the specific facts and circumstances must be reviewed before any reliable answer can be obtained.  There is a good chance that there is a cause of action for, at a minimum, moving costs and other special damages."
2223103,"Short answer: You absolutely have a case, shop around and get someone on board right away.  The Ellis Act is routinely abused by these types of landlords and unfortunately we are often stuck waiting for them to ""re-rent"" before we can do anything. Well, the time has come so please, do something!  Fight not only for yourself but all other tenants in a similar situation.   You will always get a better result with competent local tenant's rights counsel.  Many tenant's rights firms, including mine, will take the matter on contingency at no cost to you. ‰Û¬Shop around, find someone you like, and this will end very well."

However, just because it seems a good deal on its face, doesn't mean it is a good deal.  You should really discuss this with his attorney. It's possible his lawyer is simply holding a hard line for negotiating right now as you are at the beginning of a lengthy process. Also, the lawyer may be planning a suppression motion or other pre-trial motion that may weaken the state's case and this improve the deal.   The jury cannot add on charges or make the charges worse. The prosecutor can add charges, if there is evidence to support other charges.   If he is convicted, it is likely he will do time. How much time depends on the what charges he is convicted of, his history, the specific facts, the judge, and a number of other factors. This is another thing to keep in mind about the lawyer's decision: the prosecutor can recommend 10 days jail and 5 years probation, but the judge is not required to follow that recommendation. The lawyer, being familiar with the judge, may suspect the judge will not follow the recommendation in this case.  You really should discuss this all with the lawyer handling the case. He or she is in the best position to answer your questions. If you have concerns about his or her handling of the case, you can always hire another lawyer."

1818746,"There is no one size fits all answer to this question.  ""What now"" depends on what he wants to do about this.  There are often numerous defenses to foreclosure.  If your father wants to attempt to find a solution that might make a modification possible, or perhaps even to defeat foreclosure, he will need to retain experienced foreclosure litigation counsel.  He will also, as already noted, need to open an estate for his brother and have himself appointed his brother's personal representative, so that he can then properly defend and deal with the creditor.  The lien of the mortgage attaches only to the real estate, and to fixtures permanently affixed to the real estate.

1821477,"This case illustrates the vital importance of any individual retaining an attorney prior to agreeing to cooperate with police, as the attorney will look out for the individual's interests, and evaluate the pros and cons of cooperating.  In many cases, especially minor ones, it will be advisable to simply deal with the case, rather than making the decision to become a ""snitch"".  When a person works with police without an attorney, police and agents have no obligation to tell the suspect the truth, and indeed, police frequently lie to suspects to secure cooperation and get confessions.  Moreover, the identity of cooperators is often revealed in the course of an investigation, regardless of police representations to the contrary.  Anyone in this situation should consult with a local defense attorney about options moving forward, so as to ensure resolution of the case that led to the cooperation in  the first place, and to protect the suspect's rights moving forward as a ""snitch""."

A criminal defense attorney, (including a Public Defender), may have a better chance of negotiating a deal such as community service, or home confinement in lieu of jail, (especially if this is your first time being involved with the criminal justice system). I have the utmost respect for Public Defender's, but with their extensive caseload, sometimes they do not have as much time to dedicate to individual cases when compared to private counsel.  And by all means, if you are innocent, and you know the District Attorney does not have sufficient evidence, do not plead guilty simply to have the matter go away. You know the truth, and if the evidence is there, negotiating a deal early will probably be your best offer. The longer the case goes on, typically the worse the deal from the District Attorney gets."

TPR hearings, no matter what circumstance, are very serious hearings that Judges do not take lightly.  The overwhelming consensus is that the relationship between child and parent is something that courts generally should not dissolve unless absolutely necessary.  As a result, before you get to a TPR hearing, you'll likely have to go through several court appearances in addition to meetings with CPS, social services, DFS, etc.  The best thing to do is that brace yourself for what could end up being a very long process.

1823520,"it is not clear from your question whether or not you signed a written contract.  If there is a written contract then the answer to your question will depend upon the obligations laid out for each party in that contract.   If the agreement was an oral contract, i.e. I will pay you money and you give me the van, with the understanding that you would pay the remainder within a reasonable time, then she should not be allowed to keep the van and the money.   Assuming you have not somehow breached your end of the deal, if for instance your payment is late according to the terms of the agreement, you have a couple of options.  She likely cannot refuse to let you finish paying for the van (once again as long as you are not in breach).  Instead, she likely has to take payment from you, give you the title, and allow you to keep the van, fulfilling the contract you made. You say in your question that you want to keep the van, so if she continues to refuse to accept payment you may need to sue for specific performance of the contract, meaning the court will make her accept the $150.00 and give you the van and title.   If you decide you do not want the van, then it is possible you could return it on the condition that she would need to give you your money back.  I do not see a scenario where giving the car back would also result in you not getting the $900.00 back, the only exception would if there is a written contract that specifically states she doesn't have to pay you back in these circumstances.     She very likely will not be entitled to $600.00 for ""distress,"" so I would not entertain this threat. If you choose to sue for ownership of the van (or the monetary value of that ownership in the alternative), then it would be best to find an attorney that can help you put all of the evidence and facts in the best light possible for the case.  Good luck."
1815160,"I agree with my coleagues that it is POSSIBLE to settle a case in a MSC. Since neither of you have much to discuss other than the visitation schedule, it is very likely that this matter could be settled.

So, ask the court for that. Good luck."
1829850,"If your mother is unwilling to report him to USCIS as out-of-status, she might actually be guilty of an immigration violation, but unless she is also here illegally, then the worst problem she would have is a criminal matter, which a good defense attorney could handle.    If your father is here illegally and you would like to have him deported, you need only report him to ICE, although you must understand that the process of deportation can take some time.  A more direct route might be to report the criminal assaults to the police.  Once he is in police custody for the assaults, his immigration status can become known, and the deportation proceedings can being during the pendency of his criminal trial and/or incarceration.  Start with the crime. The crime gets him removed from the home.  Once he is out of the home, the deportation proceedings can commence, and he would not likely be allowed to return to the home (depending on the manner in which the assaults and crime are reported).  There are many domestic violence resources in the city, and a lawyer at any one of them would be able to assist you in filing the best report to ensure that this result would occur.  Best of luck."
1806296,"When you purchased the property inside the ""dormant"" HOA, the seller did not provide - and your attorney did not obtain for you - copies of the Declarations/Covenants/Restrictions that formed the HOA?  Presumably, the information you desire is recorded and easily obtained.  Check your title report, maybe it contains a copy.  If not , check the office of the Richmond County Clerk.  Start with their website, www.RichmondCountyClerk.com.  Good luck."

There are many experienced IP attorneys in the Los Angeles area who would be glad to help you so that you are protected.  Some of us even offer free initial consultation time.  Good luck!"

2136769,Finra is not the government but a private corporation so my question is if the case was sealed how did they find out. I would discuss your options with an attorney as there may be violations of Texas law with the use by Finra of a case that was sealdd
1821395,"As long as he has never done a diversion program before, he should be eligible for PC1000 - even with a felony possession.  If he finishes the classes and a short probation period successfully, the case can be dismissed.  If the DA insists on having him plead to the FTA, then he still has the option of Prop 36 and should be okay."
1823555,"You should consult with a medical malpractice lawyer in Texas. Leaving a foreign object like a towel inside a patient during surgery is often considered medical negligence. In Texas, her pain and suffering damages will be capped at $250,000 under tort reform laws, but any medical expenses related to the second (otherwise unnecessary surgery) and any future medical care she needs is not capped. If she suffered any lost income due to this negligence, that may be recoverable also. Make sure you consult with someone sooner rather than later, because your mom has 2 years from the date of the negligence (sometimes extended by discovering the negligence later) to bring a case. The laws in Texas also require certain pre-suit notice requirements be met. You can give us a call if you like, because we take medical negligence cases all over Texas, and nationally in federal cases."
1784785,"The best approach here is to mail two notices to them notifying them that if they do not pick them up by a certain date they will be discarded as abandoned.  Send one notice by standard first class mail and send a second one by certified mail with return receipt.  The reason for sending both is so you have proof it was sent, but if they don't pick up up the certified one, but the first class mail one isn't returned you can have reasonable assurance that it was received.  Don't rely on voice mail or texts to be enough."
1798174,"In general, the license agreement should govern each party's respective responsibilities and it may also hinge on the type of license granted (i.e. exclusive or non-exclusive) and the particular costs involved.  For example, with exclusive licenses, it is not unusual for licensees to pay some or all of the cost of maintenance fees/annuities to keep the patent in force, since the licensee in that case ""stands in the shoes of the patentee"" relative to others.  So the question as to who pays for what is really a contract issue and what the parties were willing to agree to cover.  The paries to a contract can pretty much freely agree to anything that does not violate the law or is not void as against public policy.  That is what the law calls ""freedom of contract.""  In the absence of something in the license or further agreement, the parties would most likely bear their own costs.  In addition, in most cases, a patentee would not likely do any type of searches relative  to their patent, because there is no upside, only downside (you don't want to risk finding a reference that invalidates your patent).  If you are talking about clearance searches for a product/service offering by the licensee, again in the absence of something in the license, the licensee would generally bear the cost of clearing whatever product or service they are going to be making available.  There are two basic reasons for that: (1) the licensee is in a better position to do the clearance and control the cost because they know best what they are going to do, and (2) the licensor may not care whether the licensee can actually practice the licensed patent or not -- particularly if they have no indemnity obligation.  In addition, in general, if the license does not require you to pay, your refusal would not be a breach of the license, so the patentee would not likely have recourse against you.  HOWEVER, a close reading of the license agreement would be necessary to ensure that there is no implied obligation that could be argued to create a breach of the license.  Your best bet is to have a patent attorney who litigates look at the license agreement and advise you as to what you and the other party are respectively responsible for paying.  Good luck!"
1790481,"If you're substance free and you know it, just relax.  there is no reason to get worked up over something no one has even addressed to you yet.  That noted, if you have friends who are planning a big celebration for you and it includes getting tore up, then be smart and let them party without you."
1799765,"Mental illness can be one of the factors used to justify a motion to set aside a default divorce.  Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows for setting aside a judgment based upon excusable neglect.  It would be your burden to prove that you were suffering and unable to attend.  If children are involved, this could have a negative effect, but from what you describe, it sounds like there are no children and her conduct is worse.  As to her conduct, hopefully he called police, for if there is no police record of any of the events, it's almost as if they never happened.  But at this point, he should hire an attorney.  He likely will be unable to do this himself."
1828473,"You don't need to sue.  If the defendant was arrested, go to the DA's office in the jurisdiction where the arrest occurred and ask for victim's restitution.  When the case concludes, the defendant will be ordered to pay all your damages as a result of the DUI conviction."
1803882,"You can change attorneys without having to start over.  Unfortunately, your question failed to include the State of the location of the property.  The response may vary somewhat depending on the law of that state.  As a general matter, state law establishes the procedures for service of process on a plaintiff.  The state law has to meet certain requirements to be valid under the United State Constitution.  Most states have the kinks works out, and their procedures for service of process are Constitutional.  Some states, such as New York, have service of process which allow the a plaintiff who cannot find the defendant to fashion a different method of service of process, and to obtain an order from the judge in advance approving that method.  New York Courts have many times upheld service of process by printing and advertisement in the newspaper.  You need to consult an attorney in your state to see what flexibility the service of process statute(s) have to offer. That having been said, many attorney are under enormous pressure, and clients may take an attorneys cranky disposition personally, when the attorney may actually be manifesting his anxiety to get other things done.  I would make another approach to this attorney, and gently ask him whether he state law allows him to obtain court approval for a different method of service (if you are able and willing, also acknowledge that the motion will take more time than expected, and you will cover the additional cost).  If agrees to make the motion, you are set.  If he disagrees, ask him if he will sign a consent to change attorney if you find a different one.  If he is refusing to consider the viability of making such a motion, then he probably will not refuse to change a consent to change attorney.  Make sure your are prepared to square up with the attorney, if necessary, in order to make the transition occur most smoothly."
1815512,A lawyer can help you with that.  Otherwise you are entitled to two hearings the first at which you will be given the allegations and the second you can contest the violation.  The second must be held 7 days from the first if you are in custody.

1819136,"You should first have a tax attorney, or a bankruptcy attorney with a tax background, review the lien to see if it was properly recorded.  If improperly recorded, or if the lien is more than ten years old, you may be able to resolve it without needing to file bankruptcy.  A Chapter 7 filing will not automatically strip a tax lien from the property.  In fact, it may not even discharge the IRS' ability to garnish your wages and accounts unless it meets certain criteria under the tax code. You should contact the IRS to obtain a copy of a tax transcript for the dates the taxes were incurred, the date you filed a return, and for more info on the lien."

1799745,"The problem is that you seem to be working for employers who seem to think that an H-1B filing is YOUR responsibility and you have bought into it.  YOU do not handle any of this, the employer does.  To answer your question, if you are asked where you worked, you tell them truthfully where you worked.  If there is an argument that you were temporarily assigned to a different location maybe you could argue that but to advise you whether there is a valid argument, or whether you would be committing fraud by saying you worked at a different location, there would need to be an in depth consultation with an immigration attorney.  That is how you get real, legitimate and meaningful legal advice."
1488062,"Assume that any DC license suspension with be reported to New Jersey and that they will honor the suspension reciprocally.  The system is, indeed, imperfect -- DC's reporting, in particular, is hit and miss (with a lot of miss).  However, one has to assume that the system will work as intended.  DC does not have a restricted license program, so that can't help you.  Your DC lawyer will work with New Jersey counsel to help set you up for success.  For example, if you are convicted of Operating While Impaired (OWI) instead of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), this may have a good effect in New Jersey for license suspension purposes."
1797354,"Yes, file a Freedom of Information Act request with the police agency that would have respond. There is usually a small fee. Call the proper police agency and they should have a FOIA Officer that can help."

1797119,"If you were in front of a master and it was less then 10 days since the Master made his or her recommendation you can file what is called exceptions.  However, if it has been more than 10 says since you were in front of the Master and depending on when the Order granting you custody was entered, you may be able to file a motion to reconsider (it has to be less than 30 days from the date the order granting you custody was entered).    I am not sure what you mean when you state that you have filed a Complaint and Amended Complaint?  For What?  Use and Possession?  If so, the Court is only going to consider Use and Possession during the Limited Divorce hearing and/or an Absolute Divorce hearing.    If you are looking to relocate since there is already a custody order in place you would have to file for a modification in said order (especially if your husband has regular (every other week, monthly) access to your daughter.  If you has no access or only summer access, then it may be easier for you to move without having to obtain a Court Order).  If you do file for a Modification of Custody you will first need to prove that you have a material change of circumstances that warrants the Court to modify the Custody Order.  However, even if the Court finds that there is material change in circumstance that warrants a modification, it does not mean that the Court will grant your request to modify.  The Court will weigh what is in the best interest of your daughter (like they did when they originally granted you custody).    The Court who ordered the first Order will continue to have jurisdiction over the matter, for so long as one party still resides in Maryland (i.e., you, your daughter, or your husband).    If no one resides in Maryland when one of you wants to modify the custody order, then where ever the child is living for 6 months or more will have jurisdiction (exception is if there is an emergency, then any state where the child is at that time will have the ability to enter a temporary order).  In addition, even if your husband still resided in Maryland (at the time you file for a modification), it is possible that the Maryland Court (or another Court) can determine that Maryland is no longer the appropriate state to have jurisdiction over your daughter if the Court finds that there is no longer a strong connection to Maryland (this can be requested by a party or determined by the Court itself, on its own).   As for being granted a Limited Divorce on the grounds of desertion, this can help you in obtaining an absolute divorce on the grounds of desertion, and if you are seeking alimony and/or a monetary award in the absolute divorce case, said grounds is a factor the court considers when determining, if they should order either (alimony and/or monetary award), and if so, how much (and for how long).   I strongly recommend that you contact an attorney if you are seeking to relocate your daughter out of state as relocation cases can be very difficult to argue to a Court."
1820896,You need an attorney in the state where the case is pending.
1820767,"When the Court hears a case about Domestic Violence and the request for a Restraining Order, they want to know if the person asking for the Order is in real fear for their own safety or the safety of others close by.  The fact that he did not get a temporary order shows that he did not make his case to the Court.  The further in time that the hearing happens from the incident that underlies the action, the less likely a RO will be granted.  If he really feared for his safety, there would have been no continuance. Even though you cannot ask for the case to be dismissed, it is unlikely that a RO will be granted after such a long time."
1812228,"You ahve several options. As the previous commentator noted, you can raise the landlord's failure to make repairs as a defense to an eviction and negotiate or seek a Court order for a rent abatement.  You should the landlord notice by regular and certified mail that a repair is needed.  You can elect to use the rent money to make repairs yourself. You must first give the landlord notice, by regular and certified mail,  that repairs are needed and give him reasonable time to make the repairs. The cost of the repair must be reasonable. If the landlord fails to make the repair, you can deduct the cost from the next rent payment. You should also give the landlord a copy of the receipt for the repair.   You can also file a law suit in Court seek an order requiring the landlord to make the repairs."
1793545,It depends. Did you sign any documents? Or were you given any written terms and conditions regarding the program you are in or the financial aid? Those documents would control the terms of the disbursement.
